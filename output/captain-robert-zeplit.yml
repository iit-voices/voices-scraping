      u: Well, they...so much I know they come friendly the first days but after they
        start acting against the Latvian people—very [harshly?]. In nineteen-the last
        what I see with my own eyes- in 1941, 14 June they was picking people during
        the nighttime took out from living quarters and loaded in trucks and sent
        to railroad station. And they was loaded in railroad stations for transportation
        in Russia.

      start: '00:08:20.477'
      end: '00:08:40.964'
      u: That was surprise me because I heard that the Russians they were against
        the rich people but that time they was picking over the working class—working
        class too—most of them. They were sent out from Latvia, 36,000 and I guess
        from this 36,000 there was most working class.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:40.964'
      end: '00:09:00.399'
      u: Yes - there can’t be 36,000 rich people in a small country like Latvia. Now

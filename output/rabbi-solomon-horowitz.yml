        second that there may come a group of Gentiles and kill us all. People looked
        only for thicker trees to hide. All day long people thought only about one
        thing, to save one’s life. Days passed when people forgot even about the need
        to eat. There passed entire days in which one neither ate nor slept. And when
        one became tired, one lay down on the grass. Once it rained constantly for
        three days. And it became so muddy that afterwards, when we got up, people
        got lost. We couldn’t find one another. Thus we were submerged, covered with
        mud. That is how we slept in a forest. And at the beginning the food consisted
        of mushrooms from the trees, around the trees, on the ground. There are such
        dark mushrooms.

        get to America, because, for the time being, the road to the Land of Israel

        they will be able to tear themselves through into Eretz Israel, whether legally

        together. One treasury, one food, one treatment. When one gets married here,
        it is a joyful event for everyone. Everyone joins in the happiness. A joy
        the same as if his own brother would...would get married. And his life creates
        in the people a great love of one for another. This is almost the...the most
        important asset of the life in a kibbutz.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Jews could sometimes run away from the Germans and live in the forests
      of eastern Europe, but their chances of survival were slim. Rabbi Solomon Horowitz,
      the spiritual leader of 1,400 Jews in the Polish town of Potok, led a portion
      of his flock into the woods. Less than a year later nearly all of them were
      dead.</p><p>Potok is in Galicia, the easternmost reaches of prewar Poland that
      fell to the Germans only in June 1941.The thirty-two-year-old Rabbi Horowitz
      at first attempted to placate the Nazis when they looted his people and removed
      them to the ghetto in nearby Buczacz. Later he encouraged them to hide from
      deportations that occurred in October and November 1942 and from the massacres
      at Fedor Hill in February and March 1943. His story shows once again that the
      Germans unhesitatingly resorted to mass shooting once the Jews learned about
      the death camps and began to resist deportations. It also suggests that by then
      the Germans were treating the existence of death camps as an open secret, in
      Buczacz at least. On the other hand, the rabbi’s assertion that he personally
      witnessed the Fedor Hill massacres should, perhaps, not be taken literally.
      This was a man who was both determined to convince a foreign observer of Nazi
      atrocities and unused to having his words questioned. That the mass shootings
      did occur, of course, is not disputed.</p><p>Discovered in their hiding place
      in Buczacz while trying to aid a family of homeless Jews, Rabbi Horowitz and
      his elder son slipped away from a large group of prisoners and made it to the
      forest with several hundred Jews. There they established a “family camp” of
      men, women, and children of all ages organized for survival rather than partisan
      action against the Germans. But how could they survive without reliable sources
      of food and shelter, in constant danger of being discovered by unfriendly peasants,
      and with only minimal aid from Soviet partisans operating far from their front
      lines? The rabbi provides a profoundly depressing sketch of the destruction
      of the camp during the last months of 1943. He and a handful of fellow fugitives
      lived to experience liberation by the Red Army in March 1944 by bribing a peasant
      to hide them under his barn. In Warsaw following its liberation, Rabbi Horowitz
      personally experienced the anti-Semitic climate that made a revival of Jewish
      Orthodoxy in the Polish capital all but impossible.</p><p class=”footnote”>Boder

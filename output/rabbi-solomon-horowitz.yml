      u: Yes. It is a cooperative arrangement between the World ORT which handles
        the teaching of various trades and agriculture and the Agudah which maintains
        the place and seems to own this wonderful chateau...chateau of old, rich Frenchman,
        abandoned rather in a bad state of disrepair, because the ceiling are high.
        The...to paint it and to paper it would probably cost as much as the triple
        number of apartments in America where the same number of people could live.

        In the severest frosts.

      start: '00:04:35.019'
      end: '00:04:53.146'
      u: Again a Jewish council. And the Jewish council was ordered to gather together
        all the gold and silver. Whoever has even a deka of gold, even a ring, no
        matter what, should be brought immediately. We went around. I, too, was one
        who went to collect from all the Jews all the gold in possession. We thought
        with that gold we might save ourselves for a certain time and will be allowed
        to live.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:53.146'
      end: '00:04:55.271'

      end: '00:05:14.545'
      u: Everything. There didn’t remain an iota [?]. I myself went along in order
        that it should be...should be handled honestly. I as Rabbi, because those
        members of the Jewish council were scum...Some were scoundrels [?], not such
        clean, decent people. Because usually he [the German], when he had to take
        people and go and rob...rob the...his [own] brothers, he took the scum, low
        elements. In spite of that I went along so that the gold should be delivered.
        We thought that with this gold we will save ourselves a little, for a certain
        time.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:14.545'
      end: '00:05:15.889'

      start: '00:05:16.264'
      end: '00:05:20.646'
      u: There is another point of view. Maybe they were told, the people that went
        along into the Jewish council...

        not be that bad."
    - who: Solomon Horowitz
      start: '00:05:27.858'
      end: '00:05:29.789'
      u: That is what we did. That is...that is how we figured. That is how we figured.

    - who: Solomon Horowitz
      start: '00:05:31.320'
      end: '00:05:35.830'
      u: No. I was not in the Jewish council. I was outside the Jewish council, but
        the Jewish council usually summoned me as...as an individual, as a religious
        dignitary.
    - who: David Boder

      start: '00:05:36.830'
      end: '00:05:40.711'
      u: Religious dignitary. I was of the opinion that we should give them the gold
        and silver. I was of such opinion because...so that we should save ourselves.

        to...to be killed.

        only for thicker trees to hide. All day long people thought only about one
        thing, to save one’s life. Days passed when people forgot even about the need
        to eat. There passed entire days in which one neither ate nor slept. And when
        one became tired, one lay down on the grass. Once it rained constantly for
        three days. And it became so muddy that afterwards, when we got up, people
        got lost. We couldn’t find one another. Thus we were submerged, covered with
        mud. That is how we slept in a forest. And at the beginning the food consisted
        of mushrooms from the trees, around the trees, on the ground. There are such

        is not possible to notice that anything has changed there, whether Hitlerism
        has fallen. It is not possible to observe in the Polish regions that anything
        had happened. It looks like Hitlerism. The...the extermination of Jews is
        still advocated, and they are doing....It is true, the government is still
        very well disposed. The government wants to control the situation. The government
        in Poland is very good, but they are unable to control this situation. I saw
        how in Warsaw with every step I take outside I am in danger. I caught slaps.
        I was beaten. And I had to walk. Every step I had to walk. I couldn’t ride
        on a streetcar. I had to shave. I shaved off the beard, concealed it with
        the kerchief. Thus I saw that it is impossible for me to carry out my Jewish
        life. I began to try, look for ways. I got out of Poland and came to France.

        after the liberation of Poland, there got together five, six people, no more,
        who had remained Jewish religious comrades. They went out in the street and
        they searched, simply searched for children. In Christian homes many [Jewish]children

        know you don’t have your parents. You have no family. But you are a child
        of Jews, and you have to be a Jewish child. And you should believe in God.’
        They began raising these children. Six, seven people had gathered gradually
        and assembled hundreds of children. They bought them back from Gentiles. A
        lot of money was paid.

        Gentile woman knew that it was a deal. If she has saved a Jewish child she
        demands money. People got in touch with the Joint, with the Americans and

      u: But still we are in a country where we can move about freely. The Jew is
        a man equal to all men in France. I can go out in France as a Jew with a beard.
        As a religious Jew. And I can ride on all those...on...on the Metros, on the
        Busses, the same as all...as all...as all people. This we have. In this [respect]
        we are saved. And furthermore, you should know that all the Jews have an aim,
        to go to Israel. All of them from Agudah Israel and from other parties have
        the aim, simply to have as their own a little piece of home, a little piece
        of country [?]. Some people who have relatives in America are struggling to
        get to America, because, for the time being, the road to the Land of Israel
        is complicated. But the majority consists of [us] idealists who, in spite
        of the situation there being difficult, we want solely to come to Eretz Israel.
        And this, the hope of the...this is...of the...of the...this is the...the
        expectation of all the Kibbutzim, that people are waiting, that any moment
        they will be able to tear themselves through into Eretz Israel, whether legally
        or illegally. To us Eretz Israel is always legal. Our journey to Eretz Israel
        is legal because it is our country, and we are going there as to our own.
        This is our hope.

        love of one for another becomes here forged together. All of us are constantly
        together. One treasury, one food, one treatment. When one gets married here,
        it is a joyful event for everyone. Everyone joins in the happiness. A joy
        the same as if his own brother would...would get married. And his life creates
        in the people a great love of one for another. This is almost the...the most

      u: To the American Jews. In the first place I am sending over my great gratitude
        for their initiative, for their help to all our brothers of the Shaarith Haplatim.
        To tell the truth, if not helped by America the Shaarith Haplatim would not
        be able to exist, and the surviving Jews would have simply fallen apart. Thanks
        to their initiative, their help in every sphere, that really strengthened
        the broken up, surviving Jews of the Shaarith Haplatim, and this gives them
        the possibility of existing anew and to begin living anew. But I want to tell
        our American brothers, they should know that the aid that they are giving
        is really very big. The aid is very important. But an adjustment we have not
        achieved yet. We wander from one country to another, whether we...we are sitting
        here in Kibbutz, or others in other places. But we lead a na vanat [roaming
        and wandering] life.

      u: A hard life, and we don’t see the morning before us yet. We don’t see the
        salvation before us yet. The aim of all of us is Eretz Israel. And at present
        Eretz Israel is still so complicated. The entry to Eretz Israel is still to
        complicated with various frustration, with various obstacles. They should
        know, the American Jews, that indeed they are the only brothers who can save
        us, who can help us. And they should remember always to be in contact with
        all the Jews that find themselves in Europe, and to send messengers to every
        point to become acquainted with the conditions and with what they have to
        be helped. And to help with something really important, that means, to lead
        [us] out from Galuth [Diaspora] and to bring [us] into a little safe harbor.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Jews could sometimes run away from the Germans and live in the forests
      of eastern Europe, but their chances of survival were slim. Rabbi Solomon Horowitz,
      the spiritual leader of 1,400 Jews in the Polish town of Potok, led a portion
      of his flock into the woods. Less than a year later nearly all of them were
      dead.</p><p>Potok is in Galicia, the easternmost reaches of prewar Poland that
      fell to the Germans only in June 1941.The thirty-two-year-old Rabbi Horowitz
      at first attempted to placate the Nazis when they looted his people and removed
      them to the ghetto in nearby Buczacz. Later he encouraged them to hide from
      deportations that occurred in October and November 1942 and from the massacres
      at Fedor Hill in February and March 1943. His story shows once again that the
      Germans unhesitatingly resorted to mass shooting once the Jews learned about
      the death camps and began to resist deportations. It also suggests that by then
      the Germans were treating the existence of death camps as an open secret, in
      Buczacz at least. On the other hand, the rabbi’s assertion that he personally
      witnessed the Fedor Hill massacres should, perhaps, not be taken literally.
      This was a man who was both determined to convince a foreign observer of Nazi
      atrocities and unused to having his words questioned. That the mass shootings
      did occur, of course, is not disputed.</p><p>Discovered in their hiding place
      in Buczacz while trying to aid a family of homeless Jews, Rabbi Horowitz and
      his elder son slipped away from a large group of prisoners and made it to the
      forest with several hundred Jews. There they established a “family camp” of
      men, women, and children of all ages organized for survival rather than partisan
      action against the Germans. But how could they survive without reliable sources
      of food and shelter, in constant danger of being discovered by unfriendly peasants,
      and with only minimal aid from Soviet partisans operating far from their front
      lines? The rabbi provides a profoundly depressing sketch of the destruction
      of the camp during the last months of 1943. He and a handful of fellow fugitives
      lived to experience liberation by the Red Army in March 1944 by bribing a peasant
      to hide them under his barn. In Warsaw following its liberation, Rabbi Horowitz
      personally experienced the anti-Semitic climate that made a revival of Jewish
      Orthodoxy in the Polish capital all but impossible.</p><p class=”footnote”>Boder
      interviewed the rabbi at the once grand but then run-down chateau at Hénonville
      near Paris, home of an orthodox kibbutz run jointly by the ORT and the Agudah.
      Note near the end the rabbi’s expression of Orthodox Jewry’s changed view of
      Zionism in the wake of the Holocaust.</p>\n"

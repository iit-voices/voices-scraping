      u: "[In English] August the...August the 20th, 1946. Paris. The interviewee
        is Mr. Olinsky [mispronounced by Boder], a high official in the American occupied...a
        high official in the Displaced People’s camps and [is here] on the business
        of displaced people in the American occupied zone."

      u: "[In Yiddish] Mr. Oleiski, would you be so kind as to tell us where you are
        now and what your post is in reference to the Jewish refugees, or the Jewish
        persons in the American zone?"

      u: I am now, that means I live in Munich. In Munich I have a post as member
        of the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews in Germany; and I direct, as
        an elected member, the process of ‘industrialization’ [incorporating into
        a productive life] and ‘restratification’ of the Jews in Germany. At the same
        time, I have the mandate of the society of ORT UNION and I am the director
        of the Society ORT in the whole American zone.

      u: 'The ORT society...the ORT society is a part of UNRRA, and the American Military
        Force aids with greatest sympathies the activities of the ORT. They [the Americans]
        find that the ‘restratification’...the reincorporation of the Jews into the
        process of industry, their requalification, and their preparation for a new
        life, to be one of the most important tasks to be achieved in the American
        zone. [NOTE: He uses for the second time the word Umschichtung, which would
        almost mean, ‘reculturation’. It means the return of the people from the level
        of social ‘sub-strata’ or ‘anti-strata’ to a level of social acceptability
        and dignity]. For this reason the work of the ORT is [in Hebrew] ‘in the order
        of the day’, so that all the liberated Jews may be incorporated again in the
        most important, normal process of work.'

      u: As a psychologist, I should like to know what are your greatest...greatest
        difficulties; with what kind of people among the refugees, the [ex] prisoners,
        do you have the greatest difficulties?
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:02:47.618'
      end: '00:02:47.618'
      u: "[A pause—In a solemn tone] You must understand, and so the world in general
        must comprehend, that we were condemned to perish by labor. The largest part
        of the Jewish Kibbutz [meaning here, apparently, general working communities]...of
        the Jewish Kibbutzes in Eastern Europe were annihilated. Only a small part
        [of the Jews], the healthier ones, were led away to Germany to the concentration
        camps, and there they were compelled to work hard physically...the hardest
        physical labor; and the largest part has perished. And as a consequence, a
        certain ‘complex’ has developed among the ‘liberated Jews,’ a negative attitude
        towards work. And for us, the public workers, the responsible people who stand
        at the head of the Jewish commonwealth in Germany, it is the task to endeavor
        to extirpate this negative complex, to eradicate it from the soul of the Jewish
        person, and to enlighten him and tell [him], ‘Times are different and conditions
        are different; and therefore, the attitude towards work must be entirely different.’
        And that is the most important job which I am doing at the present. We endeavor,
        by various methods, to rehabilitate the Jewish person towards work. And by
        means of this we intend to liberate him from the dark past [?] and prepare
        him for a brighter and clearer future—with faith in people, faith in life,
        and faith in himself, since this is the most important thing in achieving
        a healthy personality."

      u: Now tell me, I have little hope that I will be able to enter the American
        Zone [This refers to my great difficulties in getting clearance for Germany,
        which later, however, was obtained]. Will you please describe, how do the
        Jews live and where do they live now in the American Zone? And I also want
        to know...Tell me this and then I have some other questions.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:05:05.518'
      end: '00:05:05.518'
      u: The largest part of the Jews live in lagers in the American Zone. These lagers
        are former armories, or transient homes, and former factories which had many
        workers. A smaller part lives in [small] towns...in cities and towns. The
        dwellings of the people are not happy, not decent [citizen-like] and not pleasant.
        Several families are compelled to live in one large room; people are compelled
        to eat in large refectories, it is impossible to create that genial [way of]
        life which would...under which that great mournful past which the people have
        experienced could be forgotten.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:08.221'
      end: '00:06:08.221'
      u: Well...Go ahead...Now let me tell you, people who live in warmth and contentment...could
        possibly think that if they had survived ‘the Germans’ they would be happy
        and satisfied with anything they got. How can you explain the fact that they
        are unhappy and dissatisfied? [It is understood that this question was asked
        for the benefit of a...‘hypothetical’ future reader]...That again is a psychological
        question.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:06:47.402'
      end: '00:06:47.402'
      u: "[A Pause. He continues in a solemn voice as if ‘Once an orator, always an
        orator,’ or as if ‘No opportunity should be missed to work for the cause,
        which in his case, has definitely absorbed his existence.’] First of all [?],
        the heavy, bitter disappointment in the future. The Jews in Germany have believed
        and thought that first of all...first of all, attention would be directed
        towards those people who have gone through so much, and have lived through
        so much. And therefore, we thought that only a short time would pass and the
        possibility would be created that we would be able to depart for such a country,
        in a Jewish community, where we could lead a real life and could forget the
        ‘climate’, land, and people who brought over us so much suffering and misfortune.
        A Jew in Germany who moves about surrounded completely by Germans—among Germans—is
        unable to forget the grave experiences. Besides the Jews in Germany are compelled
        to look on and see that they who once lived a fine and citizenlike life, possessing
        everything; and then the Germans had everything taken away and have ruined
        everything that they possessed—materially and spiritually...and these people
        [the Germans] live a normal life in beautiful apartments, apartments consisting
        of several rooms; they are able to have everything. And moreover, many, many
        of their criminals go around at liberty in disguise, and are being abetted
        by the German population. And still more, one does not see any spiritual transformation
        or change in the German people. We do not hear and we do not see that what
        we have expected, and that what we have observed in other people—and especially
        among us Jews. When the Jewish people have ever committed any misdeeds against
        God or man, or nations, any social deed, any immoral deed, we had our people
        who stood up,...our prophets who shouted to the people and appealed to the
        conscience of the people, and would tell them that they had committed a crime
        and that the crime had to be atoned for.But one does not notice the like...one
        does not observe the like in the German people. And that, too, is one of the
        greatest disappointments, and that is one of the greatest outrages which plagues
        the Jewish person. And he asks...Who knows...? Who knows whether or not in
        a very short time, this malicious, poisonous swine in the heart of Europe,
        will rise again and will gorge himself, gorge himself again—to give humanity
        an encore of what he has planned before—to bring death to all progress of
        mankind?"

      start: '00:09:47.131'
      end: '00:09:47.131'
      u: Now, let us return to the concrete situation. You say people live in lagers.
        [A few words are said in whispers, apparently referring to the position of
        the microphone.] Are there complete Jewish families again? Are there married
        people with children? How do they live?
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:10:14.039'
      end: '00:10:14.039'
      u: As we came out of the concentration camps there were among us neither children
        or old people. There were only people within the ages of eighteen to forty,
        to forty-five. Lonely [single] people, wretched people. Subsequently, a flow
        of people, partisans, who had lived in the forests came. And they had escaped
        from the ghettos with their families, and those were the first children and
        the first old people which we came about to see. Third, another flow of people
        came who, too, were in hiding under ‘Aryan papers;’ were hidden in families,
        in better Christian families—they came to us with their whole families. Also,
        very many marriages were consumated within that year; and today, there are
        daily many, many weddings. And so, as if nature is intending to make good
        for this great loss which occurred due to this greatest of Jewish catastrophes,
        we see very many births at present. Daily tenths of births. The Jewish person
        who had to live all that time in concentration camps, be it as a man, be it
        as a woman, separated; and suffering at present the mighty disappointment
        in not finding his family in [word not clear]; and everyone is endeavoring
        to achieve an intimate family life. And through this fact, many families are
        being founded, close families. And still there are conditions which impede
        the founding of numerous families, since it becomes necessary to live in single...that
        several families have to live in a single room. And that is one of the gravest
        of the...[he raises his voice] better to say, not only the gravest but the
        utmost unjust treatment of the gravely tortured people, that conditions cannot
        be brought about so that the mournful past could be forgotten. That would
        be greatly enhanced if we could create conditions under which Jewish families
        could live by themselves.

      end: '00:12:47.009'
      u: Now tell me, Mr. Oleiski [the name is mispronounced]...I am a sociologist,
        I am a psychologist. Let us imagine that there is a room of this size [the
        interview took place in an average size room in the Grand Hotel in Paris,
        about 12’ x 12’, if I remember correctly] or a bit larger. How can several
        families live there? Describe it to me—it is unbelievable.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:13:07.620'
      end: '00:13:07.620'
      u: In a room in which several families have to live in is being placed a cupboard,
        or two wardrobes, and it [the room] is being subdivided in two or three parts,
        or a blanket, a comforter, or a bedsheet is hung up; and so one ‘little’ family
        separates itself from the other ‘little’ family. [The word ‘little’ signifies
        here the diminutive form of the word ‘family’, It has the meaning both of
        endearment and compassion.] Of course, it is not good indeed, because at times
        quarrels occur. People want to achieve some coziness, not only in respect
        to their foodstuffs, which are tasteless or bad tasting; monotonous, as supplied
        by the enormous refectories...canned meat...People crave at times to prepare
        their own supper in a genial moment...and [the crowded living conditions]
        become badly disturbing and very unpleasant.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:13:59.196'
      end: '00:13:59.196'
      u: Now then...the UNRRA provides the food. How is it done..? There are large
        refectories...and then...? Do people come three times a day for meals?
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:14:11.725'
      end: '00:14:11.725'
      u: 'People come three times a day to the refectories to eat, and the food is
        being dealt out there. But in recent times it was accomplished through great
        efforts, because the UNRRA did not want to agree to its...They said: those
        who get...if the food should be given, the dry [unprepared] food [be given]
        to take home, it could be used for other purposes, or exchanged [traded].
        But we provided to them that for families it is much more important that they
        get their dry supplies, that they themselves should fix their meals, and [be
        able] to prepare them the way the family knows how. And we have accomplished
        that, and though we get our supplies in the form of canned foods, a form from
        which it is very difficult to prepare a palatable meal which would make life
        more pleasant for the people...'

      start: '00:15:09.832'
      end: '00:15:09.832'
      u: Now let us take another topic. Besides...besides the training given by ORT,
        as reported [at the convention], what kind of cultural life do people have
        there?

      u: |-
        When we observe the present way of life in the Jewish lagers, we must say, and we may say it with pride, that such a vitality has emerged again among the Jewish people; and we see a Jewish social and cultural life gushing in all little corners where Jewish...Jews live communities. Take the lagers
                                Landsberg, Ferenwald [?], Feldafing. You have not only a trade school where hundreds of people learn a trade; you have not only an elementary school; you have not only a ‘People’s university,’ you also have there a kindergarten, you have a theatre, you have a choir; you have a great sports organization, sometimes one, sometimes two. You have a broadly ramified party life. All parties of the Jewish street [old-time Jewish sections of cities] and all varieties of Zionism. Hundreds of Kibbutzim [work communities]. You have everything that once existed in the Jewish towns, but with a much greater impetus, in a much broader shape. You have on top a Jewish committee chosen by democratic elections, responsible [?] for the whole social and cultural life; so that we can say with pride that the Jew has returned again...that in a social and cultural sense he has again risen to the heights. And those ethical principles which we have carried through generations are firmly ingrained into the soul of the Jew, and we see it return to full development and to full spiritual ascent, as we have seen it before.

      u: Now tell me. IT is being said that there were ‘good’ Germans, be it professors,
        be it doctors, be it artisans...There are now German socialists and the like...Is
        there any common life or intercourse between the Jews and the local German
        population?
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:17:47.556'
      end: '00:17:47.556'
      u: There is no common life between the Jews and the local German population,
        and there never will be such. There remains for eternity a wall which will
        not disappear,—a much greater wall than at one time between the Jews and Spain.
        If the Jews...if the Jews would still be living in the religious...in those
        religious sentiments, which they would...by which the Jews once lived in Spain...the
        curse which the Jews would put on Germany...the form of the curse and the
        scope [?] of the curse would be much sharper than the one evoked before...There
        is no contact and no business [?] between the Jewish...the real Jewish man.
        Sure, it may happen that a Jew from a lager may trade with a German for one
        object or another he may need, to obtain an indispensable object which he
        cannot find in the lager. But that is only an instant, a passing [episode],
        which does not signify any contact.

        meeting of the Central Committee...at the last meeting, not of the Central
        Committee, at the last meeting of the Council, there were even considered
        such proposals, to call on the Jewish committees—and the wish emanated not
        from religious people, but from people who are only nationally minded. People,
        Jews, representatives who declared that such people who could enter nowadays
        in intimate friendship with the Germans, must be ostracized [excommunicated]
        and excluded from the Jewish community. I do not see for the time being...

        Christians], I have not heard. You must know that we live altogether isolated
        in the lagers or in the cities, and the ordinary [?] Jewish girl and the ordinary
        [?] Jewish boy have longed one for the other. And in entering in a friendship
        they also longed for the Jewish community life [??], from which they were
        torn away. And that is why the weddings take place mainly in the lagers, and
        mainly between a...between Jewish boys and girls. It is possible that the
        language, it is possible that more serious relationships, it is possible that
        these [factors] impeded the instances of contact between the American soldiers
        and the Jewish...the Jewish women.

      u: Yes. One may travel, one may travel back and forth, one may freely move through
        the cities. It was only at the beginning that people had to have passes in
        order to leave the lager. But now one may travel everywhere in the American
        Zone—one may move freely. But to transfer from one lager to another, to remain,
        to live there, to freely change from one lager to another is not possible,
        because one may loose his food allotment and the other lager would not accept
        him. The lagers are mostly closed, and for new people it is very, very difficult.
        only when it pertains to a very important and useful person.

        Comrades and Friends. The Jews once had a custom that when one lived to [see] a new holiday the oration was: Shehekheyonu, Vkijmonu, vhigiyonu hazman haze. [Translation: Who hast kept us alive, hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach these times. He omits, as is often done for purposes of quotation or reference, the first half of the ‘brokha’, the blessing which in complete form reads: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has kept us etc.] And now upon the great miracle that has come over this trifle of Jews, a prayer should also be said. But where does one see the ‘zman haze’ [these times], because the zman haze is not the zman haze. It is not [the instant] that we hoped for and not [the instant] what we have come to. I have not come to you to render a report about Lithuania, my Lithuania, where I led the seventeen years of ORT work, in Lithuania. Fourteen years of normal and three years [of work] in the Ghetto. In the Ghetto, in a small little house on Slobodka [common name for the poor section of town, the other side of the tracks, simi-slums] just across the large, proud and mighty building of the ORT, which was called ‘Arise to Work,’ which I had built together with all my friends. And how we looked through the tiny windowpanes of this large, proud and mighty building. Not about this Lithuania shall I speak, and not about the Lithuanian Jews shall I now speak. I have been, I had the honor [gratification—the word is in Hebrew] to build the ORT, and to be present at the funeral of the ORT in Lithuania. I shall now speak about [the] Jews in the American Zone, about the Jews of the ‘Sheris’...of the significant name ‘Sheris Hapleitah’ [remnants of the refugees] as it is being called; the largest present-day Jewish Kibbutz] collective working community] in Germany, which counts according to our data, according to the data, of the data of the official Jewish representation chosen by democratic elections, from ninety to one hundred thousand. I shall speak today [about] the majority, about these Jews, about the Sheris Hapleitah, about those little remnants of Jews from Poland, Lithuania, Rumania and all...Hungary and all cit [ies]...countries, communities, which have perished, and the people, and Jews, who have reassembled in Germany. Before I shall turn to speak of the work of the ORT, which we accomplished in the immediate [?] months after the liberation, I consider it my duty and I consider it necessary to give you a bird’s view, a short, condensed sketch, on the way in which the present Jewish commonwealth in the American Zone was created...What kind of human material represents by itself this Jewish
                                commonwealth [ishuv]? And I should like very much to give you an insight into the difficult, abnormal conditions [under which] the struggle for life has to be waged by this, our heavily tried, suffering people of ours; and what material, what spiritual, inner and exterior factors were operative during these sixteen months after liberation—contributing to arouse deep transformations [?], deep changes in the spiritual, or better expressed, in the psychological condition—psychological thinking, of the remainder of Eastern European Jewery. With this [survey] you will understand better the whole new problematic situation which has been created by the Sheris Hapleitah and you will be able to apprehend all those problems which I wish to present to you in connection with the great, important work of the ORT as it affects the Jews in Germany.

      u: Comrades and friends. I want to be very objective—I want to be objective
        in speaking of the Sheris Hapleitah in Germany and their quandries. Although
        I am one of them in flesh and blood, I want to do it ‘facing it squarely’
        because I know that there is being talked a lot over the Sheris Hapleitah
        and much is being said about the Sheris Hapleitah, but it is being greatly
        exaggerated, be it in the positive sense, be it in the negative sense. Things
        are being overrated and understated, and many of you have no clear presentation
        about the way this commonwealth lives—this wandering commonwealth—which is
        in a constant state of wandering around; which finds itself—the homeless part
        of which finds itself—in motion; and through that [my explanation] a great
        deal will be cleared up.

      u: The important political prisoners of other nationalities journeyed back to
        heir homelands. And they were together with us in the lagers. And tens of
        thousands were in the lagers...of us were in the lagers. Not [only] Jews.
        All are [in] hospitals from the lagers. All hsopitals from cities and towns
        of Germany were occupied to capacity exclusively with Jews. And in the lagers
        the stronger [?] Jews were, the healthier ones who could move around. And
        so, as I said, the first problem which faced us was to nurse the people back
        to health.

      u: The second problem which stood before the Jews, which also preoccupied us—the
        second problem which preoccupied us as soon as one could get up on his feet—the
        second question when...what has become of our family [uses singular]?

      u: 'At the liquidation of the ghettos we were dragged away to Germany, from
        the ghettos of Poland, or the ghettos of Lithuania, we were dragged away to
        Germany, and there we were led away—after they sorted out the sick, the old,
        the children [who] were sent away to Auschwitz [an extermination camp]—we
        were sorted out; men on the one side, women on the other side; women only
        without children, and of better [younger] age. And we were sent away—men in
        one kind of lagers, men in camps of hard work; and the women also in camps
        of hard work] I don’t use ‘hard labor’ here in view of its criminological
        connotation] just like the men, to work at hard, subterranean work, or to
        work at large installations which were constructed in Austria. And that is
        why we hoped and believed that maybe somebody of our family is still alive.
        That was only...when a Jew would recover to health, there stood before him
        only one query: Go and search, where are members of your family.'

      u: And that is why in Germany during the first days, or the first months after
        liberations, one saw Jews gathered in droves at all railroad stations; Jews
        were crowding all the highways and byways across Germany. Jews journeyed back
        to Poland, Jews journeyed back to Lithuania, searching for their families.
        And these two problems were the order of the day. [Pause] In a short time
        there stood a Jewish lager, Feldafing, with three to four thousand Jews. The
        lagers were not [exclusively] Jewish. As I told you, they were mixed lagers,
        mixed with other nationalities. And it was clear that we had to take care
        of the most important problem—that we should prevail upon the military authorities
        to bring about a separation—that we should be able to have lagers for ourselves,
        Jewish lagers, in which we could be able [?] to organize our life.

      u: The Jewish were...the largest part was convinced and has hoped that right
        after the liberation they would be...that for us...the whole world will only
        think exclusively about us. [Continues with irony in his voice] They [the
        world] don’t [want] to think about peace, they don’t think in general about
        ‘nothing.’ There have remained fifteen, twenty thousands Jews alive through
        such a great miracle. Does one [the world] have to think of the future? Does
        one have to preoccupy himself at all with such a problem] problems of the
        world/? But to the greater part of experienced community workers it was clear,
        that we shall have to remain [in the DP camps] for long, and we see it already.
        We knew before the war what happened to prisoners of war, and so we knew it
        would definitely take a longer time and we would have to stay in Germany.
        And that is why we devoted ourselves to more serious problems, about how and
        what to do; and to organize temporarily the Jewish life in Germany. And for
        that reason, the political task of creating purely Jewish lagers was one of
        the utmost importance. First, because in the lagers have remained the criminals,
        and the murderers of us [those who committed at one time, crimes and murder
        against us] and of our families. There are at present in Germany not only
        [two words in Hebrew provisionally, translated as [local domestic criminals
        [?] [Germany is [not only a sediment basin of German criminals, millions of
        Nazis for whom the whole race bears the guilt for that what has come over
        us and the democracies of the whole world, but Germany is a sediment basin
        of Ukranians, Whites [here it means Czarist Russians], Poles [he uses Polacks,
        which in Eastern Europe does not always have the connotation of contemp],
        and Lithuanians and Letts—those criminals which are afraid to return home
        for the day of Judgment [reckoning] which is expecting them. And we said,
        we cannot be together with them in the lagers, and we ought not to be with
        them, and we must separate our lives and begin to build up our lives anew
        [?] on the Jewish social principles as we understand them. [Pause]. There
        was an event that journeyed back home. I said, I want to be objective, and
        I shall endeavor to be as objective as possible; but after the ‘honors of
        welcome’ which met the Jews at the border, not only a part has run away from
        the border but also those who returned to Lithuania and other countries have
        turned around in a few days [??] and returned back [to the lagers in Germany.]
        All have come back from the places to which they had returned.

        is composed of four parts. Fifteen to twenty thousand who were liberated immediately,
        as soon as the Americans alone marched in. That was the first small kernel.

      u: The second part that joined [us] was a stream of Jews who lived as partisans
        in the forests of Lithuania, Poland and White Russia; and others who had lived
        under Aryan papers. When they learned that Jews were living in the American
        Zone and that a Jewish life had more or less established itself there, and
        that [from there] it was possible to journey to other places—to the Land of
        Israel or to other relatives; and so, they came to us. That is the second
        stream. These were the first swallows, when we saw children—those were the
        first ones; when we saw old people. Until then, for three months we had not
        seen [Jewish] children and old people at all. That is the second stream.

      u: |-
        There came again a third stream of Jews. That was about in April [corrects himself], in November, December, a new stream of Jews came from Poland, Lithuania, and other lands; who were also mostly Jews who lived under Aryan papers and whose lives in Poland and Lithuania had taken on such aspects that they threw away [everything] and came to us. And the fourth great stream, which now continues to grow incessantly from day to day, is the stream after the Kielce
                                pogrom [July 4, 1946; the date of this speech is August 18, 1946, only about seven weeks later. See also postscript to Bassfreund’s story, microcards or mimeocopy]. In this short time we received from twenty to thirty thousand Jews. During the last month alone, fifteen to twenty thousand Jews have arrived. And if once we have thought that we may have to remain for a month, or two, or three, and if the Jews have born some illusionary hopes, I do not agree...I observe a phenomenon in our life, I who am about them, in them [in their midst], and between them, of a different nature [??]. The Jews brood, and go on brooding. Such life forces them to think very seriously about their future; and although they know that life in Germany will last much longer than was counted for, and if it should even happen that they should soon be admitted to the Land of Israel, the hundred thousand, it still would take a long time until this whole process would be completed.

      u: There stands before us, the Jews, urging [?] and telling [?] and admonishing
        and pleading to us—we don’t have to persuade. If we make an announcement of
        a training course in some way, we have hundreds [of applicants] and we are
        unable to accept only a tenth part of them. The Jews are occupation-minded.
        They know that there are no sentimentalities, no father and no mother, no
        brother and no sister, and nobody else can help them but they themselves.
        For a month one is a guest, [for] two months one is a guest and afterwards,
        one knows, as they saying goes, even with one’s own mother one cannot be permanently
        a guest—one must too [do something]. And this, this is a question over which
        our Jews, as you see them, over which they brood about, which they think—so
        different than in other places.

        I emphasize—in the higher military circles. But we live in an environment—and
        you should not think and believe that National Socialism has disappeared in
        Germany. It has penetrated deeply [??]; it has penetrated deeply into the
        people and they have learned absolutely nothing. I could prove it to you with

        look at the place where Hitler...the ruins which are there; so he found a
        woman teacher standing and shedding tears, standing before the house where
        Hitler proudly [?], where Hitler rose...had received Daladier, Chamberlain,
        and all the others—and she was weeping. He [Heiman] is blond, he does not
        look Jewish, he speaks German well, so he started a conversation with her.
        So he said [this word he says in German, change of set; corrects himself in
        Yiddish] he says, ‘he has brought so much misfortune over your people.’ ‘Yes,’
        she says, ‘ but you don’t know what a man he was. That was not a man, that
        was a dear man. He wanted the good so much for our people.’—That was not said

        [said] to our representatives, who among others are now in session in Frankfurt
        on the Main, that about you Jews ‘we’ have the least worries [??] because
        all the troubles [?] and disorders [?] come about from those murderers who...who
        do not want to return to Poland [???]. And in spite of that, we are so discriminated

      u: The conditions under which we live are hard, very hard. We live in lagers.
        The lagers are like [transplanted [words not clear], the lagers are former
        armories, migratory buildings which the Germans have hoisted up and carried
        away. The provisions came from community kitchens in which the food is monotonous
        and...very insufficient. Grievous provisions, bad provisions, insufficient
        provisions. If one gets, sometimes, a small package of [word not clear] or
        other...if I should have to appear before you in that what was given to me,
        I would possibly today still appear [before you] either in a dirty shirt or
        would walk the streets without a handkerchief. So it is obvious that when
        one has a package of cigarettes or something else, out goes the Jew and barters
        it out for a shirt; goes the Jew and barters; we do not occupy ourselves with
        black trading, but we barter out the various things that we get, that are
        allotted to us. And we barter them out, so that we could live more humanlike,
        so that we should remember that once we had lived like humans.

        trading [??]. Sure, but the cause of it all are the Germans—they have robbed
        us altogether of the diamonds, and our property which they have to get rid
        of on the black market. And that is why one must understand the grievous conditions
        under which we are compelled to live and one must look around [?], around
        oneself one should look, and what do we see about that life around [us] in
        Germany? Germans live in beautiful, marvelous apartments, furnished and in
        several rooms. Not in tents [?], barracks, or in lagers, four and five to
        a family...Germans travel in automobiles. We [?] are not permitted to drive
        automobiles. Germans may possess money no matter how much they got, but if
        they catch a Jew with a lot of money—Where did you get the money from? Germans

        months after liberation. We did not find our families; notwithstanding that

        before us, which constantly gazed at us -HUNGER, and that has come—[word not
        finished—compelled] and that has made intellectual people, socially conscious
        [?] people, good people, it has made into anti-social [individuals] in the

        come to the lagers of Germany, you will see little Jewish villages with a
        great social, cultural Jewish life. A motion picture house, a synagogue, trade
        schools, theatres, a choir [glee club], a library, lectures—it gushes of Jewish

        taken away the war prisoners they brought in German civilian labor. What Jew
        would have gone to work? Every Jew would say, ‘You are crazy!’ Work was considered
        in our midst [the liberated concentration camp inmates]—it has become a complex;
        work was our greatest enemy. But we understood, we, the responsible community
        workers in the lagers, that one of the most important tasks is the return
        to health of this contingent [?], of this Kibbutz. And if we want to have
        a few healthy Jews to whom the miracle has happened that they had survived—we
        must rehabilitate them and educate them for work.

      u: And that is what we did. And we did it by various means—through propaganda,
        through providing better subsistence, by giving more...we took away from those
        who did not [?] work and turned it over, to give it only to those who work.
        And we have transformed the...the lagers so that everything was done just
        by Jews. Hospitals serviced by an exclusively Jewish element, the cleaning
        of the lagers—Jews only. And there is no specialization [?] in the work; in
        spite of one...where there are three working, one could have done the work.
        But Jews work, Jews do services; there are trade schools and Jews work.

      u: And one of the most important jobs which we have undertaken, and one of the
        most important tasks which we have considered as such—only through work, only
        through trade schools, only by such means will we be able to reaccustom the
        Jew to work. Here [in such a way] he won’t feel so badly about the hard Jewish
        readjustment; here he will see not only the Jew present, but here he will
        see his future. And...and in this sense [direction] we are working[??].

      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: And now I shall turn to what we have done in the field of ORT work in Germany,
        in the American Zone. We have started our work in the month of July—it is
        then we started organizing in Landsberg the first trade schools. At the same
        time organization activities started in Feldafing [DP camp near Munich]—production
        cooperatives, tailor shops, other shops. We did that too.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: Having grown up together [penetrated] with the ORT, and the work of the ORT
        for years and years, I understood that it must start immediately. And the
        conditions were favorable to create, and to create the outlay [?] and other
        things. And here we created a large, beautiful trade school, with fifteen
        departments, where three to four hundred Jews could learn a trade. And they,
        not only did they stick to it, but nowadays after eight months of work; after
        ten months we have courses already which are being completed.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: We have organized the schools [programs] in concentric periods—by levels.
        First three months. We did not [?] know that we would sit around twelve or
        sixteen months. But then we saw that three months had passed, so we extended
        [the courses] for six months, and nine months and twelve months.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: And so we have created the opportunities [to continue??]. And Dr. Lwovich
        [the director of the European ORT with its office in France] came to us and
        we...we didn’t know, we lived, in general, cut off. One has to understand
        our critical situation. We did not know, in general, what is happening to
        the Jews altogether—whether there was an ORT at all, whether there are Jews
        in France. If one would see a Jew from France people would storm around him
        [??] from right and left. It was not known that there were Jews in France
        or in other countries, and whether an ORT was alive. And it took three or
        four months for a letter.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: And when Dr. Lwovich had come to us, friend Lwovich told us to start working.
        He told us that he would give us help. So it was a ray of joy for us. And
        we threw ourselves at still more work, and we went to another lager, a second
        one, a third one; and nowadays we have two and a half thousand Jews learning
        a trade in the American Zone. Listen to this [??], we have seventy courses
        today...seventy-five. But we have a variety of courses. Twenty-five courses
        that I could enumerate for you but I don’t want to take so much time because
        I still want to talk briefly over the tasks before the ORT—Twenty-five courses,
        various courses, machine shop, wood shop, automobile works, machine shop and
        extra welding shops, plumbing, radio, typewriter, carpentry, weaving, ceramics,
        womens’ wear, millinery, [word not clear], underwear, [word not clear]—whatever
        you want [word not clear], bookkeeping; all courses are filled and when I
        arrive at a lager I find a desk full of requests—’come to the Land of Israel
        [?] and install trade schools.’
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: And that is the situation today. We have received help from Switzerland.
        Switzerland has given us not only machinery and tools, but my stay in Switzerland
        has given me...it refreshed me. Since my stay in Switzerland I came to see
        a new world and new people. I started remembering [thinking about] a new life.
        And so I began to conceive new forms of rehabilitation and new opportunities.
        I have seen the new, the new, and I beheld a people, a land which has not
        gone through the holocaust—and from which one may learn...and I am introducing
        it now into all the schools, and I assemble my teachers and I enlighten them,
        and so the work proceeds.

      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: 'We have before us a great work, which I want to sketch before you just briefly.
        Possibly it will emerge later during the debate—but now I want to tell you
        thus: before the American Zone stands a very great, important fact. UNRRA,
        the military, whoever you want, who knows who finds it proper [??]; they want
        that the Jews should be kept busy. The Jews should be occupied working. We
        too, want it. But we say thus: we want it on different grounds. We want that
        Jews should be occupied with work only for the sake of two aspects. One aspect
        is that demoralization should not go on further, and that the uncertainty
        [this is definitely a guess. The word is not clear and appears much more forceful]
        which gnaws [?] at us from day to day, and the despair.'
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: And the second moment [aspect], since we know, and we don’t make any illusions
        to ourselves, we know that the Jew, when he should come...wherever he should
        come, if he should not have learned a trade he will be socially, entirely
        ruined. If he should come to the Land of Israel or any other land without
        possessing a trade he will go through another disappointment which may lead
        we know not to what.
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: We know, we know what every Jew has gone through, what he carried inside
        himself. And that is why we say, ‘We are ninety thousand Jews; we want to
        work; we want that the American authorities should give us the possibilities.’
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: What kind of work do we want? We have from forty-one to forty-five thousand
        Jews which could be occupied out of the ninety thousand. We estimate that
        from the ages of sixteen to forty-five...we estimate that...that these are
        seventy-five percent of us. A young element—an element for work. We are able
        to occupy about from two thousand to two thousand five hundred [corrects himself],
        from twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand in industries. We want to work.
        We have Jew arte...artesans; we have Jews in various skills. We say, ‘gladly’;
        order and we shall do it. For the American Military—gladly! We shall do it—it
        shall be done. Give us factories. There are factories in Germany in which
        we could work for them. We could take them over under our administration,
        start them going and occupy Jews; and not be working for the depreciated,
        insignificant package which we are given there, and for the inferior canned
        stuff and other things [he refers to small packages which were designated
        for prisoners of war and remained in the storehouses of the Red Cross]. We
        should get paid for the work in such factories in American currency. If you
        don’t want to pay him here, fine! You will pay him abroad, wherever he should
        emigrate. He should have it in the future to build his life, and he should
        be able to settle in some way.

      u: And that is the most important. Besides, we expect to occupy about ten thousand
        Jews in the trade schools. We expect to occupy about five thousand Jews in
        production cooperatives. But we want to have modern Jewish agriculture [implements]
        from, form the former Nazis and from former ‘others of the kind,’ so that
        we should be able to absorb then ten thousand Jews in agriculture [a few words
        not clear—his emotions rise to a high pitch].
    - who: Jacob Oleiski
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: 
      u: That is our endeavor [???]; that we should be able to achieve these mighty
        tasks which have fallen upon the Sheris Hapleitah [remnants of refugees]—[intensive
        applause, and knocking of the gavel.]

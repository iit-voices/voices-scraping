      u: "[In Polish] [unintelligible]Due to the audio quality of the reproduction,
        an accurate Polish transcription was not possible. Boder’s English translation
        from  reads: “I would like to tell you, my friends, that all of us Jews ought
        to hate the Germans because of the wrongs which they did to us and our families,
        because they broke our hearts, broke our homes, and we ought never to forget
        that.”4"

      u: This was a kind of a postscript that I wanted to have, because it’s exceedingly
        important to have the feelings of these young people. We notice here that
        she spoke in German, in English, in Polish, and when it came to express her
        feelings she preferred to express it in Polish. This polyglotism, or multilinguistics
        if we want to call it that way, represents a psychological and ethnic problem
        at the same time.

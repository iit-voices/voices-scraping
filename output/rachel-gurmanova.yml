        in the ORT, had work certificates [?] and had the right to live. Temporarily.
        Of course, afterwards everything went to naught. In these confines [??] the
        Ghetto remained until the 22nd of June, 1942. During that time terrible things
        happened. For instance, there was a certain Kort, a communist, by the name
        of Kort. The Gestapo found out that he was in Warsaw and they came to arrest
        him. So, he drew a revolver, killed two Gestapo men, and ran away, fled. For

        lawyers, engineers, they were shot at the citadel, that is, at the fortress...

        the insurrection of Bor [This is the famous insurrection of the Polish general

        And it was not comfortable. There arrived also a sister of the friend of my

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Rachel Gurmanova was a committed woman of the political left, and that
      made a world of dfference in determining her fate. She avoided stipulating her
      politics in the interview, but internal evidence suggests that she was at least
      close to the Polish Communist party, in which Jews were disproportionately represented.
      This gave her intimate contacts among non-Jewish Poles in Warsaw, friends who
      saved her life by spiriting her out of the ghetto on the eve of the 1943 revolt,
      after which she “passed” as a non-Jew. Previous to that she had avoided deportation
      by making herself useful to the Warsaw ghetto administration and, indirectly,
      the Germans. Since 1921 she had been secretary of the Polish ORT, the vocational
      training organization founded in Russia in 1880. Since the Germans needed skilled
      Jewish workers, the ORT was one of the few prewar Jewish institutions preserved
      under German rule. And yet, her position was no absolute shield from deportation
      as her description of a close call makes plain. Trapped by chance in a public
      square during a raid, she exploited confusion and a ruse thrown out by a friend
      to melt into the crowd of onlookers.</p><p>Beyond providing valuable information
      about the ORT’s work in the ghetto, Gurmanova intelligently comments on several
      other aspects of ghetto life: the work she was forced to do for the German Trusteeship
      Office, which collected and organized the movable property of Jews who had been
      deported or killed; Nazi manipulation of the Jews’ psychological vulnerability;
      and the courthouse forming part of the ghetto wall in which Jews and non-Jews
      might still make precarious contacts. She also makes it clear that without official
      corruption and the money to exploit it, her story would have ended quite differently.</p><p>Rachel
      Gurmanova exposed her personal grief reluctantly and only after gentle prodding.
      Apparently she lost most of her family, including her mother and her son; she
      never mentioned her husband. Unable to begin again in Warsaw after the war,
      she moved to Łódź and threw herself into rebuilding the ORT. Technically she
      was not a displaced person. She was visiting Paris as a delegate to a world
      ORT convention when interviewed in August 1946, and she was clearly determined
      to return to Poland and reestablish Jewish life there.</p>"

        with bread, and distributed to the population. They made no distinction between
        Jews and Christians. And they distributed soup which they passed around in
        field kitchens. That lasted about two, three days. Then they began to make
        two different lines: for Christians and for Jews. And it would just so happen
        there was enough for the Christians and for the Jews [there was] not.'

        They started taking small things, larger things, anything they liked. When
        they were through with the homes they started with the stores. And they took
        things. They paid — for a fur coat they would lay down fifty marks. They wouldn’t
        take for ‘nothing’ — like fine people they would pay.

      start: '00:05:23.990'
      end: '00:05:40.849'
      u: And they started dragging the Jews to work. There were various places. There
        were [places] where the Jews would work through a day, they would get a bit
        of soup, would get a gread and off they went for home. But there were places
        like, for instance, the parliament. The parliament, the congress...

      start: '00:05:41.428'
      end: '00:05:53.400'
      u: That was a terrible place. There happened to be such people, the Germans.
        There they were murderously beaten. One either got killed or they would last
        there for four weeks and died afterwards.

      u: Domassa [??] it was called, on Leszno Street, there too, it was bad. And
        there were various harassments. There were all kinds of incidents. On the
        streets one had to take off his hat, and greet [them]. There was no objection
        against it, but there were individual Germans who would beat Jews for not
        having taken off their hats. Some Germans demanded that the Jews should not
        walk on the sidewalks, they should step aside, they should walk in the middle
        of the street. If a Jew did not step aside he would be forced on his knees,
        they loaded bricks on him [??] and so he had to stand as long as it was their
        pleasure. Again they were beating [people]. They would catch intelligent people
        on the street for various labors. They especially looked for the intelligent,
        for the better dressed. They were, would tear off on the street cold weather
        clothing, fur coats. They started a terrible persecution of Jews, a most violent.
        Then they started abusing [??] they took away the better apartments from the
        Jews, the nicer ones. Subsequently they took them also from the Poles. But
        mostly from the Jews. The Jews were thrown out first from better apartments.
        They took away the furniture.

      start: '00:07:26.148'
      end: '00:07:36.938'
      u: They constructed several. They did not say that these were lagers. First
        of all they put up a demand that there be formed a Jewish, a Jewish council.
        They should have with whom to deal [??] They do not want to talk to all the
        Jews.

        could dispatch all required business. And so there was formed a Jewish council,

        on the Pawiak Street. And so every day at 2 o’clock there was a change of
        the guard. The Germans. And they used to arrive on vehicles. They would travel

        the head. Bashinfg in heads. And then the Jews started watching out. Let us
        say between one and half past two there could not be seen a Jew on Bracka
        [?] and Jerozolimski [?] [streets] and in that general direction. People endeavored
        not to go [there]. Of course, to enter and to take people out of their homes,
        that was an everyday occurrence. This was of no consequence. The situation
        of the Jews was terrible. They were driven together from the whole Warsaw
        district into this small Ghetto. I don’t know whether you are well acquainted

        to the other side of the Zelezna. Because the middle was outside the Ghetto.
        That was Chlodna street [??]. This was still called tolerable. But on the

        The Jewish council paid nothing. That must be told. But one would get something.
        Provisions one would get [apparently for services in the council]. People
        knew already. If something was distributed in the Ghetto, a bit more food,
        that meant already that there will be an action. Before every action it was
        done that way, they gave a bit more food. There was a time, during the deportations,
        when it was laid out on the tables. So and so, people are being sent out for
        work; because there are so many people in Warsaw, so those who will present
        themselves voluntarily will get two Kilogram of bread, with a Kilogram of

        The Jews. Always, when they came, when they were herded together, from the
        whole...[countryside]...from all the little towns. The ORT helped all the
        artisans. They were driven out of their homes, say in ten, fifteen minutes.
        And they could take nothing with them. So it was necessary to give a tailor
        not only a [sewing] machine, but he had to be given [she enumerates hastily]
        a machine, a mannekin [??] a flatiron, a table and stool, and [she names three

        begging. I am through with begging.’ These were joyful moments. And the other

        at 5 in line one had to stay overnight in the village. And then there was
        an order that no stranger could stay there overnight under penalty of death.
        And so, I went four times, there and back in one day. Fifteen kilometers back.
        And there in the town itself I had to walk about ten kilometers. I got sick,
        And could not get the permit. Until once, when I was going again to the village,
        I cried bitterly, and it happened that my mistress was also going to the village.
        And she asked me : ‘Why are you crying?’ So I tell her, ‘It won’t help you
        anything. You won’t be able to hold me...’'

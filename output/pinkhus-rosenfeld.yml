        about which I know. A friend of mine took a child and gave it narcotics, and
        he put it in, one might say, in a far corner of the courtyard, because he
        figured that the police would go through the house in two hours, and he put
        it in such a hole and on top he strewed a little sand, just so it should not
        be known. And thus he saved his child. The largest majority could not find
        counsel to help themselves. There were cases that mothers went with the children.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Anti-Semitism in depression-era Poland impelled some Jews to leave for
      healthier homes. Naturally that was always easier for persons of means, and
      Pinkhus Rosenfeld’s family, owners of a successful textile factory in Łódź,
      had already purchased a residence in Palestine preparatory to emigration. Hitler
      intervened.</p><p>With more resources than the average Jewish resident of Łódź,
      some of Rosenfeld’s family attempted to escape the worst of the occupation by
      moving to Warsaw, only to find conditions there become as bad as those at home.
      In the end this divided the family between the two cities. Pinkhus’s parents,
      brothers, and two daughters, separated from him in Warsaw, disappeared into
      the machinery of destruction. Pinkhus, his wife, and two sons remained in Łódź
      until its ghetto was liquidated in August 1944. Although in the interview he
      took pains to distance himself from the Rumkowski administration, there can
      be little doubt that it required pull to get and keep the coveted job of food
      distributor, one of the few ways of getting enough nourishment to stay alive.</p><p>In
      1944 Rosenfeld was separated from his wife and two young cousins at Auschwitz
      and never saw them again. He and his teenage sons, however, managed to stay
      together, and they were healthy enough to be selected for work in Germany. There
      they were comparatively well treated. Marched into the Sudetenland as the Reich
      collapsed, they were simply abandoned by their SS guards and, after the fighting
      ended, recuperated in Prague. Although they contemplated smuggling themselves
      into Palestine in 1945, health considerations persuaded them otherwise. When
      interviewed at the ORT school near Paris in September 1946, the forty-three-year-old
      Rosenfeld was understandably impatient that he and his sons had not yet been
      granted entry to Palestine, indignant that his ownership of property there had
      not opened all doors.</p>\n"

      end: '00:02:04.819'
      u: 'When the war started I was a Polish soldier. My active military service
        I spent on the battlefield. The 19th of September that is when the war was
        in its 19th day, I fell prisoner to the Germans. From there I was taken with
        many thousands of prisoners to Germany. From there I was taken with many thousand
        prisoners of war to Kutno, and they held us in a small building, five thousand
        prisoners of war crowded in. Without water, without the least sanitary requirements.
        Bread we got—hundred fifty gram [about 5 oz.] a day. We were given a bit of
        bran, and without water, without salt. That was the treatment [the fair].
        [Footnote 1: He endeavors to speak German, or possibly his Yiddish has become
        altered due to prolonged contact with Germans. This leads often to an inappropriate
        choice of words. —D.P.B.]'

      end: '00:02:07.734'
      u: Were there Polish soldiers also with you, Christian soldiers.
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:02:07.734'
      end: '00:02:17.996'
      u: There were with me together also Christian soldiers. From there we were delivered
        to Germany.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:17.996'
      end: '00:02:19.837'
      u: Now what happened then?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:02:19.837'
      end: '00:03:00.574'
      u: In Germany after six weeks as war prisoners we got for the first time some
        water to wash up a bit. The conditions were very bad. Soon they started to
        separate the Jews. We were eight Jews in one c mpany among thirty thousand
        military prisoners. I was [sentence not clear]—Polish Stalag A, at Altengrube,
        at Magdeburg. There we vegetated for a hard six months.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:00.574'
      end: '00:03:02.083'
      u: What does it mean—vegetated?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:03:02.083'
      end: '00:05:03.567'
      u: Vegetated means we led a hard, bitter life. After six months, not according
        to our desire, but on the desire of the Wehrmacht, all Jews which belonged
        to the regions occupied by Germany had to be returned. And we were shipped
        home. En route—we were “discharged” in Lublin. There they took off literally
        everything from all the military prisoners. The boots which I had because
        I belonged to the artillery were pulled off my feet. The overcoat, the coat,
        nothing was left but the pants and underpants, so they left me stand. Without
        a shirt. Winter. That was the second of March, 1940. There the custody was
        taken over by the Wehrmacht, SS, which was assembled from among the youth
        of Polish hoodlums and skum. There were youths of sixteen, seventeen years
        [of age], who did not know how to load the arms, but they knew how to shoot.
        And many were in that way murdered by them. There the conditions were exceptionally
        bad. Each day appeared like a year. After spending eight days in this lager,
        I arrived home. At home I still found everybody alive. But every Jew was already
        wearing the all-known Jew-star. There were already streets on which Jews were
        not permitted to walk.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:03.567'
      end: '00:05:06.223'
      u: What was the name of your [little] town, where you had come.
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:05:06.223'
      end: '00:06:03.835'
      u: I had come to my [little] town Olkusz. That’s my place of birth. There I
        remained until the evacuation [depopulation] of the town. Before speaking
        about the depopulation, I shall narrate, report one incident. On the 31st
        of July 1940, there took place a punitive expedition against my town. On an
        early morning at four o’clock, at daybreak, on a Wednesday, the whole town
        was aroused from sleep and put on its feet. And all men without distinction,
        Jews, from sixteen to fifty years of age, were taken out to various squares.
        They were taken out by the Gestapo. A few thousand Gestapo.man arrived, in
        a town which had a population of only about fifteen thousand, and they started
        punitive expedition.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:03.835'
      end: '00:06:05.973'
      u: Why was there a punitive expedition?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:06:05.973'
      end: '00:06:55.581'
      u: The punitive expedition took place because sixty dilometers from the city
        were murdered by bandits two gendarmes. But they felt it useful to make of
        it a political incident. And it was ordered to make responsible for it the
        peaceful [civilian] population. We were led out at daybreak, with our hands
        up, they jabbed us with bayonets and we were compelled to run. When we arrived
        at the square, we had to pass a cordon. On both sides stood SS men, with [metal]
        rods, belts, rubber truncheons, clubs, [?] and they beat us. Every one had
        to go through. People went through the cordon, and emerged covered with blood.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:55.581'
      end: '00:06:56.595'
      u: Women too?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:06:56.595'
      end: '00:07:36.390'
      u: No women. Women were not taken, that time, only men. Then afterwards each
        had to show his fingerprint. After giving his fingerprint [it is possible
        that they had to surrender their identification cards which bore a single
        fingerprint] each one was tripped from the front over a leg a thrown down
        to the ground. We were made to lie on the stomach, the face deeply pressed
        to the earth, with the hands on the back. So we remained lying until twelve
        o’clock. And the SS men were passing back and fro, and when it pleased him
        he trampeled [the person]. I personally was hit several times with the boot
        on the head. At twelve o’clock they came...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:36.390'
      end: '00:07:37.495'
      u: Twelve o’clock noon?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:07:37.495'
      end: '00:08:20.841'
      u: Twelve o’clock noon, after lying for eight hours we were ordered to get up.
        Everyone was pale and black. Wo all looked like dead men. So there spoke to
        us a gestapo man in the Polish language, while another explained [interpreted].
        That we are being treated most humanely, because they are still able to prove
        who is against God and against humanity. I and those others present, could
        of course, not understand that people could be treated still, worse, but that
        we have learned in the future.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:20.841'
      end: '00:08:22.036'
      u: Now...
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:08:22.036'
      end: '00:08:39.088'
      u: Afterwards he explained to us the reason for the event. It was because two
        gendarmes were murdered. Among those present was a Polish ‘prister’ [the word
        was not clear, and caused a question].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:39.088'
      end: '00:08:40.960'
      u: "‘Prister’ is what, a policeman?"
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:08:40.960'
      end: '00:08:44.117'
      u: No ‘Prister’ is a priest, a clergyman.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:44.117'
      end: '00:08:44.859'
      u: Oh, a [in German] ‘priester’?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:08:44.859'
      end: '00:08:56.690'
      u: Yes. He explained among other things, that those here present are not criminals,
        that they are simply peaceful citizens. For that he was murderously beaten...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:56.690'
      end: '00:08:57.385'
      u: Who, the priest?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:08:57.385'
      end: '00:09:01.296'
      u: The priest, because he dared to say such a thing.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:01.296'
      end: '00:09:02.987'
      u: Nu...
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:09:02.987'
      end: '00:09:03.488'
      u: And after...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:03.488'
      end: '00:09:04.544'
      u: And the SS were Germans?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:09:04.544'
      end: '00:09:11.727'
      u: The SS were Germans, and also many Folk-Germans.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:11.727'
      end: '00:09:13.357'
      u: Yes. What do you call...What do you mean by Folk-Germans?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:09:13.357'
      end: '00:09:24.735'
      u: Folk-Germans, that means Poles who later had declared, saying that their
        forefathers, their grandmothers had something in common with German blood
        [ancestry].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:24.735'
      end: '00:09:27.380'
      u: Yes...Nu...
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:09:27.380'
      end: '00:09:43.424'
      u: Afterwards by two o’clock there came the moment when they ordered all the
        people to disperse. I want still to make one remark. When they came into our
        house, we had a scroll of the Torah [holy scroll].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:43.424'
      end: '00:09:44.481'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:09:44.481'
      end: '00:10:06.893'
      u: And the SS man came and ordered to open the Torah, and then he asked us whether
        we still believe in God. So I asked him, why should one not believe? So he
        said, that at a time when so much evil is done to you, and nothing happens
        to us, so where is your God? So I involuntarily exclaimed—something will still
        happen to you.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:10:06.893'
      end: '00:10:07.889'
      u: What did he say?
    - who: Jacob Schwarzfitter
      start: '00:10:07.889'
      end: '00:10:11.652'
      u: He said, why doesn’t anything happen to us [to the Germans]. So I said it
        will still come to happen.
    - who: David Boder

      end: '00:10:21.250'
      u: 'But he still left me alone. [It also could mean: he still left it—the Torah—with
        me]. That was on the thirty-first of July nineteen...1941 [corrects himself]:
        forty.'

        No, the Jews were removed ‘out of town’. And they erected posters on both sides of the city, at the border [city limits], saying that the Jew who should dare to trespass without permission of the local authorities, will be sent to a concentration camp. And about the concentration camps we knew from hearsay, because the famous KZ
                                Auschwitz was from us at a distance of about forty kilometers.

      u: Yes, there were houses. They took the Polish population—out of the villages
        and into the town.

        [Here a few words, are not clearly spoken, apparently away from the microphone].
        There we remained from the 15th—9th—1941, until the 11th of June, 1942. Then
        occurred the complete liquidation of the town. They arrived also at day-break,
        they woke us all and took us out, young and old. Nobody was spared. We were
        taken to a big center, where it stood written without any subtleness—’exterminatory
        action’.

        of the Jews.

        to our town, which is about thirteen kilometers from my town. And so was annihilated,
        one of the oldest Jewish Kehilas [parishes] in Poland. From there I was transferred
        to a lager, a transit lager, Dulag [abbreviation for Durchgangslager] which
        it was called in Sosnowiec. From Sosnowiec I was transferred on the 17th of
        June, 1942 to Blechhammer. There were the UHW works, that means Upper-Silessian
        Hydraulic Works. There worked up to sixty thousand foreign workers, among

        about real butter. That time it was not yet a concentration camp, it was a
        lager for compulsory labor. There at work I had an accident. I was hurt by

        poisoning. In spite of that I was compelled...I suffered for six weeks. And
        my comrades took me to work [leading me] under my arms. And to work I had

        had hidden money from home, which was most strictly prohibited, so we purchased
        additional cigarettes, so that we could buy off the guards, so that they should
        not so harden our years [mistreat us] at work. In that lager if one could
        not work, he was given “fifty” [blows] with an oxtail [?], on the naked body.
        And in the winter he had to strip naked in the greatest frost, jump into a

        And then [word not clear] there were unfortunately such people who fell in
        disfavor to the great gentlemen, and they beat them constantly. So we agreed
        among us that we shall go with a proposal, that daily ten men will report
        for beatings to sooth their bestial instincts, and to request, that in a lager
        of seven hundred people, that on every seventieth days each one would be beaten,
        and not to beat day in and day out the same people, with the result that they
        were being beaten to death. Of course, he rejected the proposal. From this

        before a committee of the SS, which picked out the strong ones and sent away
        the weak ones to be ‘melted down’, as they called it.

        Jews, and in general we remained five hundred Jews together. Afterwards there
        were added Jews from Bunzlau, from Bunzlau. Afterwards there also arrived
        a transport of Jews who were Hungarian Jews. They came to us the 5th of June,
        1944. Our KZ was dissolved [?] the 9th day of May, 1944. [The apparent disruption
        of continuity is his own]. There [?] life was still somewhat tolerable. We
        had a good cavalry commander, that is we had an SS man who was in a compulsory
        manner, dragged over from the old guard regiments into the SS. He did not
        permit any chicanery. This lasted until the start...until the start of the
        offensive from the East. With the forward push of the Russian troops, when
        they arrived on the other side [??] of the Oder,...then they started to evacuate
        our concentration camps. We left the eleventh of February, 1945. We left under
        the roar of cannons, the shouting of the Russians. The Russians already fired
        over the city. A few hours later the city was occupied. But we have been already
        led away by the SS. En route, the first few hours were rather quiet. We stayed
        overnight fifteen kilometers from the town in the nearby village. There a
        few men tore themselves away from our column. The second day, again, a few
        people...

        attempted to hide, life was bitter, the conditions became worse, there was
        no food, the cold...These hid themselves; more than a hundred people. That
        became conspicuous. Then they started throwing hand grenades into the barns.
        That means, at those who slept in there [?] and they shot with machine guns,
        and there fell twenty-two people from among us.

        of bread, but the bread was full of sawdust mixed with wood shavings. So he
        explained that after six weeks he did not work anymore, but the block-elder

        the two professional criminals, and the two guards. And they started angrily
        to beat us, and they said, yelled, ‘You damned Jew-band, you don’t want to
        croak?’ So they said: What, you don’t want to croak when so many people are

        tension for the moment of liberation. And there took place a violent race.
        The race was between time and our strength, physical strength. Will we still

        to struggle—so superhuman was the struggle. Because not only were we moved
        by the egoistic drive to desire to live, and to hold out. Because today, when
        everyone of us, and I, for example as well, when I should consider all that
        I have gone through, because it is impossible to tell about it in one hour,
        in two hours, in a week, it is impossible..., all the details I have experienced.
        But if today it would have come about to experience for one month, what I
        experienced during years, I should definitely not go through with it. Because
        we held out for the reason that we did not know what the morrow shall bring.
        And there we lived with the hope that the morrow will be better, a more beautiful...But,

        world in general, is so unfriendly. Nowadays the despair is much grrater than
        before. Before we would say that only Germany is destroying..., destroying
        our life. Nowadays we know that we are liberated people. What do we have?

        progress of Technology and Culture, such things would not happen anymore.
        And we say a contrary occurrence; that with the progress of technology and
        science the barbarism..., the barbarism of humanity progresses still faster.
        For that reason, and I shall take advantage of this opportunity, and want
        to say one thing. I understand very clearly that we enter a very hard struggle.
        The English Empire is surely stronger than we are. But we have a single weapon,
        the general satisfaction which is thus: that every people that rises against
        us Jews meets an evil end. Beginning with the Romans [word not clear], Babylonians,
        Greeks, Spanish, and also Zarist Russian and finally, Hitler Germany. And
        we are most surprised, that that second Jewish folk, England..."

        gravest moments of the war, we were [inside Germany] the only confederates
        who wished for the victory of the Allies. If we were unable to express it
        with deeds, so we did with our wish, there still are such [should that mean
        a mystic power?]...with our prayers, that England should win the war. In addition,
        so many, more than a million Jews have fought in the armies of the Allies.
        They fought for the same slogan that means Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood.
        Add where is the Liberty, and where is the Equality, and where is the Brotherhood
        that was to come to us Jews? I want that the whole world should know. I understand
        that England had a giant ocean fleet, air..., air fleet, also strong ground
        forces. But what good are Armies, at the moment when we have the only strong
        army, of which I spoke before. We have the satisfaction, the historical satisfaction,
        that everything that impedes us must go. And besides, we have old rusty weapons.
        And the weapons of today, the sharpest weapon is called despair [word not
        clear]. We are desperate.

        we have our own bread. Because it does not exist, it is not worth the economic
        strength and the political strength. We have seen it ourselves. So, in Poland
        we also had rich Jews. And they went the same way as the poor ones. For that
        reason, you [the Americans] should help us, if there is still a certain measure
        of conscience in you, so we could build our own abode. We do not want to push
        aside anybody, [three words, not clear]. We want to transform the desert in
        good vineyards we want to create for ourselves a healthier future [?], a better

      u: Here in Italy the Hachsharas,in general, are not organized as the ones in
        Germany. In Germany, for instance, there were agricultural Hachsharas and
        trade school Hachshara. Here we have come not to stay, here we have come to
        get away as soon as possible. We wanted to go straight ahead, to get to our
        final goal. But unfortunately, due to the occurrence of various obstacles
        [?] we had to remain. And we believe the time shall not be a long one.

        Rumanian and Hungarian communities who were in the Ghetto. Because not all
        Rumanian and Hungarian Jews were led out.

        which now take place in Poland. And about Italy letting them in [the last

        Polish women who have been hiding Jews. They hid them. And the Jews have married
        them.

        out for it [??]. They say that if they should come to a permanent [?] place,

      u: On Yom Kippur there was just nothing. It could happen that on Yom Kippur
        they would assign us to the worst labor. When they knew that there was a special
        [Sacred] Day they plagued [us] especially, still more.

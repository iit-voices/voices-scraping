      u: 'When the war started I was a Polish soldier. My active military service
        I spent on the battlefield. The 19th of September that is when the war was
        in its 19th day, I fell prisoner to the Germans. From there I was taken with
        many thousands of prisoners to Germany. From there I was taken with many thousand
        prisoners of war to Kutno, and they held us in a small building, five thousand
        prisoners of war crowded in. Without water, without the least sanitary requirements.
        Bread we got—hundred fifty gram [about 5 oz.] a day. We were given a bit of
        bran, and without water, without salt. That was the treatment [the fair].
        [Footnote 1: He endeavors to speak German, or possibly his Yiddish has become
        altered due to prolonged contact with Germans. This leads often to an inappropriate
        choice of words. —D.P.B.]'

      u: In Germany after six weeks as war prisoners we got for the first time some
        water to wash up a bit. The conditions were very bad. Soon they started to
        separate the Jews. We were eight Jews in one c mpany among thirty thousand
        military prisoners. I was [sentence not clear]—Polish Stalag A, at Altengrube,
        at Magdeburg. There we vegetated for a hard six months.

        sec: '303.567'
        mark: '00:05:03.567'
      u: Vegetated means we led a hard, bitter life. After six months, not according
        to our desire, but on the desire of the Wehrmacht, all Jews which belonged
        to the regions occupied by Germany had to be returned. And we were shipped
        home. En route—we were “discharged” in Lublin. There they took off literally
        everything from all the military prisoners. The boots which I had because
        I belonged to the artillery were pulled off my feet. The overcoat, the coat,
        nothing was left but the pants and underpants, so they left me stand. Without
        a shirt. Winter. That was the second of March, 1940. There the custody was
        taken over by the Wehrmacht, SS, which was assembled from among the youth
        of Polish hoodlums and skum. There were youths of sixteen, seventeen years
        [of age], who did not know how to load the arms, but they knew how to shoot.
        And many were in that way murdered by them. There the conditions were exceptionally
        bad. Each day appeared like a year. After spending eight days in this lager,
        I arrived home. At home I still found everybody alive. But every Jew was already
        wearing the all-known Jew-star. There were already streets on which Jews were
        not permitted to walk.

      u: I had come to my [little] town Olkusz. That’s my place of birth. There I
        remained until the evacuation [depopulation] of the town. Before speaking
        about the depopulation, I shall narrate, report one incident. On the 31st
        of July 1940, there took place a punitive expedition against my town. On an
        early morning at four o’clock, at daybreak, on a Wednesday, the whole town
        was aroused from sleep and put on its feet. And all men without distinction,
        Jews, from sixteen to fifty years of age, were taken out to various squares.
        They were taken out by the Gestapo. A few thousand Gestapo.man arrived, in
        a town which had a population of only about fifteen thousand, and they started
        punitive expedition.

        mark: '00:06:55.581'
      u: The punitive expedition took place because sixty dilometers from the city
        were murdered by bandits two gendarmes. But they felt it useful to make of
        it a political incident. And it was ordered to make responsible for it the
        peaceful [civilian] population. We were led out at daybreak, with our hands
        up, they jabbed us with bayonets and we were compelled to run. When we arrived
        at the square, we had to pass a cordon. On both sides stood SS men, with [metal]
        rods, belts, rubber truncheons, clubs, [?] and they beat us. Every one had
        to go through. People went through the cordon, and emerged covered with blood.

        mark: '00:07:36.390'
      u: No women. Women were not taken, that time, only men. Then afterwards each
        had to show his fingerprint. After giving his fingerprint [it is possible
        that they had to surrender their identification cards which bore a single
        fingerprint] each one was tripped from the front over a leg a thrown down
        to the ground. We were made to lie on the stomach, the face deeply pressed
        to the earth, with the hands on the back. So we remained lying until twelve
        o’clock. And the SS men were passing back and fro, and when it pleased him
        he trampeled [the person]. I personally was hit several times with the boot
        on the head. At twelve o’clock they came...

      u: Twelve o’clock noon, after lying for eight hours we were ordered to get up.
        Everyone was pale and black. Wo all looked like dead men. So there spoke to
        us a gestapo man in the Polish language, while another explained [interpreted].
        That we are being treated most humanely, because they are still able to prove
        who is against God and against humanity. I and those others present, could
        of course, not understand that people could be treated still, worse, but that
        we have learned in the future.

      u: No, that was margarine butter, in a concentration camp there was no talk
        about real butter. That time it was not yet a concentration camp, it was a
        lager for compulsory labor. There at work I had an accident. I was hurt by
        a rusty bolt, that is a wheel with rusty teeth hurt my leg, and I got blood
        poisoning. In spite of that I was compelled...I suffered for six weeks. And
        my comrades took me to work [leading me] under my arms. And to work I had
        to go. If not, there was a place, and one was sent away to the famous lager
        Kozel.

        And then [word not clear] there were unfortunately such people who fell in
        disfavor to the great gentlemen, and they beat them constantly. So we agreed
        among us that we shall go with a proposal, that daily ten men will report
        for beatings to sooth their bestial instincts, and to request, that in a lager
        of seven hundred people, that on every seventieth days each one would be beaten,
        and not to beat day in and day out the same people, with the result that they
        were being beaten to death. Of course, he rejected the proposal. From this
        lager, where there were seven hundred people, there remained approximately
        hundred and three people at the time of the liquidation of the lager.

        1944. Our KZ was dissolved [?] the 9th day of May, 1944. [The apparent disruption
        of continuity is his own]. There [?] life was still somewhat tolerable. We
        had a good cavalry commander, that is we had an SS man who was in a compulsory
        manner, dragged over from the old guard regiments into the SS. He did not
        permit any chicanery. This lasted until the start...until the start of the

        over the city. A few hours later the city was occupied. But we have been already
        led away by the SS. En route, the first few hours were rather quiet. We stayed

        what was the cause that he remained. So he explained to me. For six weeks
        he still has been working. At mealtime they gave there four hundred grams
        of bread, but the bread was full of sawdust mixed with wood shavings. So he
        explained that after six weeks he did not work anymore, but the block-elder
        would write down that he had gone to work, and he would give to the block
        elder hundred and fifty grams [of his bread ration].

        strength and the political strength. We have seen it ourselves. So, in Poland
        we also had rich Jews. And they went the same way as the poor ones. For that
        reason, you [the Americans] should help us, if there is still a certain measure
        of conscience in you, so we could build our own abode. We do not want to push
        aside anybody, [three words, not clear]. We want to transform the desert in

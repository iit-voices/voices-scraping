        You will never get out of here. You won’t see liberty.’ We noticed that the

        to give a little piece of her own in order to help to support her health.
        And thanks to such an organization in which we have committed ourselves to
        help one another, we saw that we would be able to save ourselves. And we also

        and hid a lot of things—clubs, [one word not clear]. So if they should come
        to exterminate us, block by block, we should defend ourselves, and we should
        tear the wires, and cut the electricity, and we should blow up the crematories.
        That happened in the winter [?] of ’44. When they came to take a detail for
        gas-killing in the gas chambers, our men with whom we were organized together—thanks
        to our organization- they blew up two gas chambers. And since that day they
        did not gas-kill [?] anymore. [See story of Anna Kovitzka, Spools no. 164B,

        lager. And there were no more transports by that time. That was in 1944.

        In Ravensbrueck I also was taken once to be gassed; because, although I was
        only thirty-four years old and I looked like a woman of fifty or fifty-five
        years. There was a very great selection of the people who had come from Auschwitz.
        We were all driven outside and the elder of the lager, and he stood and selected
        the older women, who were to go in gas, and the younger women, who were to
        remain for work in the front trenches. He asked me how old I was. I told him
        I was thirty-four years, so he slapped me twice. He threw me to the ground;
        he trampled me with his feet; he beat me and he said to me, ‘You dirty woman
        that you are. You believe that you may present yourself as a young child.
        You shall go into the gas chamber with all...the old women.’ And he put me
        among the old women. I made every effort to wiggle myself out. I wiggled myself
        out from their hands and ran away. I was able to run away because at that
        day there was a mass raid [?] for the gas chamber and they had no time to
        take the younger ones. They put the older women aside [kept them] until night,
        and at night they were led away to the gas chamber—to the Jew lager, as it
        was called. And so I extricated [wiggled] myself because I had run away, and
        I took my place again in line, in the following line, so that I could pass
        by again.

        mean [that there is] an organization. Then I would have to betray the others.

        the SS women would tell us, ‘Don’t laugh’. You have come here to die—to croak.
        You will never get out of here. You won’t see liberty.’ We noticed that the
        lager was an extermination lager, and that we shall not come out of there
        alive. So we started to organize ourselves around the BUND [a Jewish-Lithuanian,
        and Jewish-Russian social-democratic organization, which originated still
        in the time of the Zcar]. Only political women who have come to the lager
        and who knew that they live to fight against Fascism and Hitlerism. So we
        started to organize resistance in the lager. We could not accomplish much
        with our work, because we had nothing in our hands. When a woman would get
        sick in the winter—we were permitted to wear only one shirt and one dress,
        and not [?] a little piece of warm underwear. So when we would see that one
        has become sick—she would get pneumonia or some other disease—the healthier
        women would take off their underwear and give it to the sick one. And so we
        all kept up the spirit of each other [???]. When one would get sick, and we
        did not want her to die, so we gave a little piece of bread. Everyone had
        to give a little piece of her own in order to help to support her health.
        And thanks to such an organization in which we have committed ourselves to
        help one another, we saw that we would be able to save ourselves. And we also

        exterminate a detail of women [corrects herself], a detail of men, so the

        that a ‘transport’ meant gas. ‘We are already too long in the lager not to
        know where you will lead us. Everytime when you say ‘transport’ it means gas.
        You either lead [the people] to a gas chamber in Auschwitz, or you lead them
        to the gas chamber in another lager. [She is very agitated and is not clear
        in places]. -You think [?] to take us into the gas and burn us in Birkenau.

        materials from there and given to the men who worked in the crematories. So
        that when the moment should come that they would start exterminating the lager,
        they would blow up the crematories. And the men made a good showing. They
        blew up both crematories; they cut the wires; and they ran away. But the SS
        men ran after them—they shot at them. Many were apprehended; they were beaten
        and clubbed and afterwards shot, and the majority were shot on the road. When
        their two crematories were destroyed no more people were gas-killed in the
        lager. And there were no more transports by that time. That was in 1944.

        majority were shot. And that is how we arrived in Breslau. Breslau is the
        border [town] between Poland and Germany. We were loaded into open railroad
        cars [gondolas or flat cars]. That was the eighteenth of January. In the summer,
        the time of the great deportations, we were loaded into closed, stuffy cars.

        and with sick women, because I had the people [?] from the sickroom. The five

        only thirty-four years old and I looked like a woman of fifty or fifty-five
        years. There was a very great selection of the people who had come from Auschwitz.
        We were all driven outside and the elder of the lager, and he stood and selected
        the older women, who were to go in gas, and the younger women, who were to
        remain for work in the front trenches. He asked me how old I was. I told him
        I was thirty-four years, so he slapped me twice. He threw me to the ground;
        he trampled me with his feet; he beat me and he said to me, ‘You dirty woman
        that you are. You believe that you may present yourself as a young child.
        You shall go into the gas chamber with all...the old women.’ And he put me
        among the old women. I made every effort to wiggle myself out. I wiggled myself
        out from their hands and ran away. I was able to run away because at that
        day there was a mass raid [?] for the gas chamber and they had no time to
        take the younger ones. They put the older women aside [kept them] until night,
        and at night they were led away to the gas chamber—to the Jew lager, as it
        was called. And so I extricated [wiggled] myself because I had run away, and
        I took my place again in line, in the following line, so that I could pass

        no drink and we were thrown into the gas chambers. That all, they were capable
        of doing. But when they saw that there is already shooting in Berlin, and
        that Berlin was being bombarded; and now we were in Ravensbrueck, eighty kilometers

        women were working who were politically well-trained, and that they had stolen
        the explosive materials for the crematory. So they arrested six girls who
        were betrayed. Because one was most horribly beaten, all six girls were...were
        beaten; but one did not behave well [one could not hold out] and betrayed
        the others.

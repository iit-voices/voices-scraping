      start: '00:02:02.308'
      end: '00:02:02.308'
      u: It was quiet until the Germans made the Ghetto. In the Ghetto our agony began.
        All our...the entire misery began in the Ghetto. And so, after a long time,
        after a...not such a long [time], after a month’s time the Germans gave a
        new order, that all Jews have to wear white bands with a blue star of David.

      start: '00:02:26.336'
      end: '00:02:26.336'
      u: From that time began our whole...whole agony. After that, there had again
        passed two, three, months, [and] the Germans said that this is impossible.
        So many Jews in Warsaw, because from all the little towns Jews came to Warsaw.
        From Lodz, from all other cities, Jews came to Warsaw. [They said,]’This is
        impossible. The Jews have to be resettled.’ And so an order was given to the
        Jewish...Jewish Council in Warsaw that every day six thousand people have
        to be delivered for resettlement to the East. The Jewish Council...people
        didn’t know yet at that time what was going on here, what the Germans are
        going to do with us. People thought that they are really going to resettle
        us to the East, so that there should be less people in Warsaw. And so the
        Jewish Council said that it will do it. After a few weeks it was seen that
        the people don’t want to come [go] Everyone wants to remain at home. And so
        the Germans themselves began to grab on the streets...

      start: '00:03:29.055'
      end: '00:03:29.055'
      u: What comprised the Ghetto of Warsaw?

      start: '00:03:40.827'
      end: '00:03:40.827'

      end: '00:03:46.304'

      start: '00:03:54.673'
      end: '00:03:54.673'
      u: And so they took by the blocks [Blockenweise], by houses. They would take
        and surround a house, and it was called out, ‘All Jews fall in!’ And those
        who didn’t come down were shot. They used dogs, various other methods. They
        went into the apartments and looked for the people who were hiding. After
        that the Jews began building bunkers to hide. That means such cellars, covered
        with mortar, various other things, in order to be able to hide well. One shouldn’t,
        be able to discover it. And so we, that means I, My mother and my father,
        built....It cost a lot of money. We built our own bunker, and there we prepared
        provisions, food. We should be able to wait there. Maybe we will be able somehow
        to survive the whole...

      start: '00:05:34.544'
      end: '00:05:34.544'
      u: On that we lived all the time. After that people found out that all the transports
        that had left...it was not, alas, for resettlement East, like the Germans
        had said, but it was for extermination in such a lager that was called Treblinka.

      u: Yes. And then began a terrible panic in the whole Ghetto. Everybody...people
        didn’t know what to do, because people knew that if one goes to Treblinka,
        it is death! It is a prepared death. One is gassed and so on. Now everybody
        was already building bunkers. Anybody who only had the means, whoever had
        a few...a few Zlotys in the pocket built bunkers.

        emptied. Nobody, no one can remain. And meanwhile there were in the Ghetto
        already about a hundred thousand people who had remained at that time in the

        their hands. They saw with any other means they won’t succeed, only by setting
        everything on fire. They took and set fire to house after house, house after
        house, everything burning, and the people had no other way out. They had to

        say? People were already taking leave of one another. They were praying, everything.
        And there came a day, two days later, we saw our house is burning. There was

        German hands? This was not good either. But we had no other way out. We got
        up. We took the knapsacks. We wanted to go up. It was very difficult to go
        upstairs, because the stairs were already burning. The smoke was going upward.
        Still we ran through and we came up. We looked out on the street, and there
        stood only Germans. The armed SS stood with rifles and were watching where
        a Jew might come out. But we were afraid to go out. We were afraid that we
        will be immediately shot. We stood downstairs and waited till the bricks were
        already falling on [our] heads. Everything was hot from the fire. It got so
        that we couldn’t stand it any more. We saw that there comes out from the other
        house, from across...it was also burning...comes out a group of Jews or perhaps
        seven or eight people with little...with two little girls, go over to the
        Germans, to them. We saw that the Germans are not shooting them. They were
        put there against a wall. They were searched , and they were arranged in groups
        and led away. Then we calmed down a little, because we saw that one isn’t
        shot on the spot. And so we came out with the hands in the...the air. We went
        out. The Germans surr-...surrounded us.

        those who were going to...to Treblinka or to Majdanek. There was the point
        where all the people were concentrated. There came the trains, and we were
        all...from there all the people were transported away. And so we arrived there,
        at the Umcshlagplatz [distribution depot] We saw many dead lying right next
        to the Umschlagplatz. And the Ukrainians, those German bandits...

        They were laughing. They nearly burst from laughing, from joy. And so we arrived

        we were sent away. It was said that we are going to Treblinka to [meet our]
        death. So I knew that if one has to die, better let it be another death and
        not to be gassed. And so we traveled. Soon there appeared some Jews who had
        concealed in the shoes, in...inside the shoe tops they had concealed such

        after them. The main thing is that after ten minutes I had thought it over.
        I had considered it. I knew That I had left the mother and father at home.
        And so I...I decided to jump. This is it! What will happen will happen. I
        got out on the roof, and the Ukrainians were standing on the steps of the

        can fall under the train. But if one jumps on a hill, one falls, rolls down
        the hill, right down there. And so, I thought it over well and jumped. I don’t
        remember any more, but I felt that legs hurt very badly. And I heard a shot.
        After that I came to. After perhaps two, three hours I came to, and I saw
        nearby two children are playing with a...with such a...such a large hoop,
        playing, running, jumping. I started yelling, and the children ran away and

        at the distribution depot, didn’t imagine that it would be so terrible now,
        because when I was there before it was not so bad at the distribution depot.
        Now the Ukrainians were standing on every step. One had to take off the hat
        before them, stoop, bow before them. If one did not bow correctly he immediately
        got it with the rifle over the head. So we were taken upstairs. They made
        a search...a search. The men were undressed nude, the women nude. They looked
        for money. They were always looking for money, money and diamonds, all things.

        people did not have any money, because everything had been taken away there
        at the distribution depot during the search, but there were found some people
        who still had some money. They gave away the pennies so the window would be
        opened, to let in a little air. And people were fighting and beating each
        other, because everyone wanted to get close to the window. Everyone wanted
        to catch a little air. Nu, after riding for four hours, people could not stand
        it any more. Standing up there was no air. All the people already...a few
        people had already fainted. There were already a few suffocated. And so the
        train stopped at some station. The locomotive had to take on water. We didn’t
        have a drop of water. We begged, we cried through the windows to the...the
        Gentiles, ‘Bring us a bottle of water or anything. We will give you money.’
        There came over a youth, wanted to give water. The Ukrainians shot him right
        on the spot. A little boy wanted to give water. He was shot right away, shot
        on the spot. He...

        rode because we had no watches. People did not think at all about time. People
        thought just about getting out, be it Treblinka, be it Majdanek. Just to get
        out of that train where we...every minute we thought we are going to suffocate.
        And so we heard a call, ‘Majdanek. Everybody out.’ The train was immediately
        surrounded by...by the gendarmerie, and we were all chased out of the train.
        Into every train [car] ran a few Ukrainians, and they took and chased everybody
        with rifles from the...the trains [cars] They did not look who it was, whether
        a...a woman or a man. They just struck, beat with rifles over the heads. They
        chased out in one line everybody on...on...on a...on a...such a platform.

        And so you can imagine, everybody...how is it possible after riding such a
        long time where we didn’t have a drop of water, were so weakened. Suddenly
        we were told to...suddenly here we are told to run. And so we did run. Many
        people did fall to the sides while running. They ordered [us] to run still
        faster, still faster. The bath was a long distance away. Coming to the bath,
        they said, ‘No, this is not good, You shall wait. You will be sent to another
        bath.’ And so we were already thinking now we are being sent to another bath.
        We were sure that we are being sent already into such a gas house where we
        will be all gassed. All of us were already more than sure that we are going
        to be gassed. Nu, people started taking leave of one another again. And we
        were separated. The women taken separately. The men were taken separately,
        and small children were taken separately.

        highway. And when one went on the highway...we were going to work in columns.

People already were thanking God that we had been sent away from there, because people knew that if one stays there any longer, a little longer, another week, two weeks, we could not hold out.

It was not a lager for extermination like Majdanek or Skarzysko. This was a lager for politicals. We were received rather nicely. The prisoners did for us whatever they could. And most they did for the younger ones. That means [those] up to seventeen, eighteen years. He immediately ordered food, because we were so starved. We were soon given to eat. And we remained in Buchenwald. We remained...I was [there] eight or nine months. I don’t remember too well. we were given into a block of...Buchenwald consists of two lager, a large lager and a small lager. In the small lager that means it was much worse than in the large lager. In the small lager were only people, those who worked very hard, no, worked not so hard, bit they sat [around], had little to eat, and so forth. We, the younger ones, were transferred to the large lager. I was in block number twenty-three. This was a special block, a Jew-block, The Germans called it. And there I was two months. I rested up before I went to work. All that, thanks to the Jewish prisoners who had arranged everything so well that we shouldn’t have to go to work immediately, but we should be able to rest up for a couple of months. And so we had rested up for a time, and then we went to work. The work was not so hard. The work consisted only of a few bricks...to carry bricks, because they were building, the Germans were building there various bunkers and so forth. Kitchens they were building. And so it went on till the bombing. That means for the bombing there arrived...one...one day there arrived Anglo-American aircraft, and they bombed. That means they were probably so well informed, the Germans...eh...eh...the English aircraft, that they did not bomb the lager but they bombed everything round and round the lager. That means the German SS armoires and all the important...important German points they bombed. The lager itself they did not bomb.

        they succeeded in extinguishing the kitchen. And the work went on, but not
        any more like before. The Germans cut the food a little. They gave worse food,
        because a lot of provisions were burned. They gave us worse to eat, and the
        work had become harder, because we had to rebuild everything that the...the

        time have...the few younger boys all escaped from the Jewish block and ran
        down to the small lager. There in the small lager was also a Jewish block
        under a...a...the block elder was a Czech, really a very good man. Another
        block elder like that could not be found. And he received us in his block,
        and he said...The Germans arrived and asked if this is a Jewish block. He
        said, ‘No, I don’t have even a single Jew here in the block. There are only
        Christians here. Yugoslavs, Poles, only...Gentiles. There is not a single
        Jew.’ And he had to sign that he had none in the block, because the Germans
        did not know any more exactly which of the blocks are Jewish, because all
        the papers, everything had been burned down during the bombardment by the...during
        the bombing.

        over the lager. One Russian airplane flew over the lager. We signaled. We
        threw hats in the air. And the Germans who were in the towers around the lager

        Are we animals or people? We were running dressed in the prisoner uniforms.
        We ran over to a tank and started to talk to him. Accidently we found out
        that he is a Jew [in] that tank. His name was...I don’t remember exactly.
        I think Birnbaum was his name, or something like that. An American Jew. And
        he gave us right away to eat. He gave us canned food and chocolates, and...and

        officers, had been caught. All were herded into one block and a few people
        were detailed to guard them. And now the Germans had to remove their hats

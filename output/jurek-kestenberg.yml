        So many Jews in Warsaw, because from all the little towns Jews came to Warsaw.
        From Lodz, from all other cities, Jews came to Warsaw. [They said,]’This is
        impossible. The Jews have to be resettled.’ And so an order was given to the
        Jewish...Jewish Council in Warsaw that every day six thousand people have
        to be delivered for resettlement to the East. The Jewish Council...people
        didn’t know yet at that time what was going on here, what the Germans are
        going to do with us. People thought that they are really going to resettle
        us to the East, so that there should be less people in Warsaw. And so the
        Jewish Council said that it will do it. After a few weeks it was seen that
        the people don’t want to come [go] Everyone wants to remain at home. And so
        the Germans themselves began to grab on the streets...

        in the Ghetto, but the relatives were living on the other side of the Ghetto.
        When we had built the bunker....We had built it, and the relatives came [over]
        to us. The family from the other side of the Ghetto consisted of my two aunts,
        my uncle, and also two cousins. And so they came. And my uncle belonged to
        the underground organization. The first...the first week of the battle my
        uncle was shot by the Germans, and we remained.

        stood only Germans. The armed SS stood with rifles and were watching where
        a Jew might come out. But we were afraid to go out. We were afraid that we
        will be immediately shot. We stood downstairs and waited till the bricks were

        seven or eight people with little...with two little girls, go over to the
        Germans, to them. We saw that the Germans are not shooting them. They were
        put there against a wall. They were searched , and they were arranged in groups
        and led away. Then we calmed down a little, because we saw that one isn’t
        shot on the spot. And so we came out with the hands in the...the air. We went

        dinner. And after dinner people had to take everything out and throw it away
        outside. And so after such work, after a day of such work people could not

        well, if it was not to the Germans’ liking, he immediately got clubbed, beaten.

It was not a lager for extermination like Majdanek or Skarzysko. This was a lager for politicals. We were received rather nicely. The prisoners did for us whatever they could. And most they did for the younger ones. That means [those] up to seventeen, eighteen years. He immediately ordered food, because we were so starved. We were soon given to eat. And we remained in Buchenwald. We remained...I was [there] eight or nine months. I don’t remember too well. we were given into a block of...Buchenwald consists of two lager, a large lager and a small lager. In the small lager that means it was much worse than in the large lager. In the small lager were only people, those who worked very hard, no, worked not so hard, bit they sat [around], had little to eat, and so forth. We, the younger ones, were transferred to the large lager. I was in block number twenty-three. This was a special block, a Jew-block, The Germans called it. And there I was two months. I rested up before I went to work. All that, thanks to the Jewish prisoners who had arranged everything so well that we shouldn’t have to go to work immediately, but we should be able to rest up for a couple of months. And so we had rested up for a time, and then we went to work. The work was not so hard. The work consisted only of a few bricks...to carry bricks, because they were building, the Germans were building there various bunkers and so forth. Kitchens they were building. And so it went on till the bombing. That means for the bombing there arrived...one...one day there arrived Anglo-American aircraft, and they bombed. That means they were probably so well informed, the Germans...eh...eh...the English aircraft, that they did not bomb the lager but they bombed everything round and round the lager. That means the German SS armoires and all the important...important German points they bombed. The lager itself they did not bomb.

      u: "[In English] Well, this concludes the interview with Jurek Kestenberg, seventeen
        years old, from Warsaw. the beginning of this interview is on Spool 11, and
        this is Spool 12 [A] Well, Jurek [words not clear]"
  commentary:
    text: "<p>The power of family ties during the Holocaust, especially for very young
      Jews, can scarcely be exaggerated. Jurek Kestenberg escaped from a German deportation
      train, recovered from a gunshot wound with the help of a compassionate Polish
      peasant, but made his way back to his parents in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943,
      well after it had become known that the Germans were exterminating Jews at Treblinka.
      Jurek’s age was difficult to determine; he said he was twelve when the Germans
      attacked Poland, thirteen in 1943 when he was sent to Majdanek, and seventeen
      at the time of his 1946 interview. His confusion was understandable after a
      long period during which he lied about his age to assure being assigned to work.
      He was the only child of a Warsaw Jewish industrialist and his wife. Their factory
      had been bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1939, but their savings sufficed to see
      them through ghettoization, build and maintain a hiding place in the ghetto,
      and spirit a five-year-old relative into hiding with Gentiles. Jurek told of
      his escape from the train and his return to the Warsaw ghetto as an afterthought
      to his memories of the ghetto uprising, which he spent in hiding with his family.
      In fact, the earlier events may be the most telling part of his story.</p><p>Following
      the suppression of the Warsaw ghetto uprising in May 1943, Kestenberg was sent
      to Majdanek together with his parents. There his mother was separated from her
      husband and son and probably perished. During the short time the two males remained
      at Majdanek, they worked on the Scheisskommando that carried human excrement
      from the cesspools to the camp gardens. Although it is sometimes argued that
      the SS left members of this work detail alone in order to avoid contact with
      the filth and smell, Jurek’s interview shows that the guards found ways of tormenting
      them as they struggled with the unwieldy vats. Then Jurek and his father were
      sent to work at the giant HASAG ammunition factories at Skarżysko-Kamienna.
      There Jurek watched his father sicken and die from overwork and undernourishment,
      the fate of thousands more like him.</p><p>As the Russians approached Skarżysko
      late in July 1944, the Germans evacuated his work group to Buchenwald. Jurek
      evaded the evacuation of Jews from Buchenwald in April 1945 with the help of
      a Czech block senior. Resettled in France with the help of Jewish charities,
      he was studying to be a dental technician in Paris and living in the ORT home
      at Chateau de Boucicaut at the time he gave his interview.</p>\n"

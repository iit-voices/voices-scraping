      u: "[In English] Germany, September the 12th [23rd], 1946. Feldafing about 30
        kilometers from Munich, a camp for displaced...a camp for displaced Jews covering
        about forty-five hundred people. Part of the camp is located [?] in a form
        of barracks of the Hitler Youth. I am having a room here in one...I am having
        a room here in one, and the floors are [here] what they call in German parquet,
        fine [inlaid] hardwood floors. The illumination,, although the tension of
        the current is weak, is in very fine armatures [fixtures.] There is central
        heating. There was an interruption...A large field, practically a city of
        barracks and barracks and barracks all over. All are occupied by displaced
        Jews, but I see a number of temporary buildings, private buildings. I am also
        told that several hundred families are billeted in German homes. That is of
        course a rather interesting, rare situation, and the Germans are being forced
        to find decent location for people with [DPs] families. These people are not
        fed by the camp. They have food ration cards and live on their money. What
        kind of money? — Well some [of them] managed to bring something [possibly
        post-armistice refugees from Poland, etc.] Some probably receive it from the
        States, and South America, and Africa. And the black market also helps."

      u: 'We are now going to interview Mr. Max Meyer Sprecher, 37 years old. He is
        at present...at present a student of medicine at Heidelberg University. He
        was a student before, and continues his medical student...[correction] studies
        now. He is going to speak to us in Yiddish...[Note: for some reason this interview
        was abruptly interrupted. The continuation is on spool 147.]'

      u: "[In English] This concludes the interview with [unintelligible], and we
        are going over to an interview again with Mr. Max Meyer Sprecher, with whom
        we started on Spool 146. Munich, September the 23rd...Munich, September the
        23rd, 1946. We are not working here exactly under very ideal conditions."

      u: "[In German] [unintelligible] And so Mr. Sprecher will you please tell me
        again where you were when the war started. Were you over in Germany?"

      u: Yes. Talk Yiddish.
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:00:47.062'
      end: '00:01:08.556'
      u: I was then in Germany. I returned from the refugee camp in Beuthen on the
        German-Polish border. I was in ’38, the 28th of October, ’38, sent together
        with the Polish Jews from Germany to Poland.

      start: '00:01:08.556'
      end: '00:01:10.370'
      u: From what city were you sent?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:01:10.370'
      end: '00:01:17.420'
      u: From Berlin. Together with many thousand Polish Jews over the ‘green border’
        to Poland. [‘green border’ apparently means the border line away from official
        points of entrance.]
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:17.420'
      end: '00:01:20.167'
      u: Had Germany then occupied Poland?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:01:20.167'
      end: '00:01:28.270'
      u: No, there was an ‘action’ specifically directed...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:28.270'
      end: '00:01:40.804'
      u: "[In English] We were interrupted again. These are quite trying conditions,
        to work in this camp; but we are beginning now again with Mr. Sprecher."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:40.804'
      end: '00:01:44.558'
      u: "[In German] So let us continue. And so beginning with the ‘green border’
        continue..."
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:01:44.558'
      end: '00:01:51.601'
      u: The ‘green border’ is a field which is located between two countries.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:51.601'
      end: '00:01:52.633'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:01:52.633'
      end: '00:02:44.532'
      u: There...it is not covered by any border guards. It is open, free. And so,
        since the Jews who were lead there did not want voluntarily to cross the border,
        the field, they were surrounded by German police with machine guns, and they
        were chased and compelled to cross the green field into Poland. For Germany
        we were Polish citizens. For Poland we were not Polish citizens. Therefore,
        we were interned in the Polish border city Bedzin, Zbolshin[?] in Polish,
        and remained there a very long time, almost three quarters of a year.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:44.532'
      end: '00:02:46.858'
      u: Continue. And then you say...
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:02:46.858'
      end: '00:03:25.252'
      u: In the course of time a possibility was found through an understanding with
        the German government, that a part of the people should be enabled to return
        and take with them the most necessary things, which they had left behind in
        Germany. Because the major part of the people had come simply...had brought
        with them only what they had...what they were wearing on their bodies, nothing
        else. A part returned in order to arrange their immigration into other lands.
        In this case I returned with the intention [the word is in Hebrew].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:25.252'
      end: '00:03:26.638'
      u: With what?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:03:26.638'
      end: '00:03:51.839'
      u: With the [translates]...with the purpose to continue the studies of medicine,
        and not in Germany, but in Switzerland. I have sent from the camp Bedzin my
        matriculation booklet to Basel with the hope to be accepted there by the university.
        But instead of going to Basel, to the university, I landed in a concentration
        camp.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:51.839'
      end: '00:03:54.556'
      u: Well. In what lager did you land?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:03:54.556'
      end: '00:04:36.880'
      u: It was the 13th of [September]1939. On the 1st of September the war broke
        out with Poland. Between the 5th and the 10th we had to register in Berlin
        as enemy aliens. The Gestapo proclaimed specifically, against us personally,
        a number of security orders, and at dawn the 13th, between four and six o’clock
        in the morning, we were arrested and taken en masse to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg
        near Berlin, fifty-five minutes by streetcar from Berlin.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:36.880'
      end: '00:04:39.567'
      u: Is Sachsenhausen the same as Oranienburg?
    - who: Max Sprecher

      end: '00:04:57.841'
      u: |-
        Sach-...The lager
                            Sachsenhausen and lager...and concentration camp Oranienburg were at that time one and the same. At the founding of the lager, the lager was started in a small factory building next to the city Oranienburg.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:57.841'
      end: '00:05:00.257'
      u: And Sachsenhausen is there nearby?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:05:00.257'
      end: '00:05:08.300'
      u: |-
        Then, a kilometer farther away...one and a half kilometers away is located the large lager
                            Sachsenhausen.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:08.300'
      end: '00:05:13.635'
      u: Now describe the life in Sachsenhausen.
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:05:13.635'
      end: '00:05:29.182'
      u: I cannot comply completely with this request, because soon after the arrival,
        and after the registration we were transferred to a strict quarantine. We
        were isolated from other lager...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:29.182'
      end: '00:05:31.568'
      u: Yes, but tell me what happened to you there?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:05:31.568'
      end: '00:05:40.875'
      u: We were brought in there, seven hundred and fifty Polish Jews, into three
        blocks, at two hundred and fifty Jews in each block.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:40.875'
      end: '00:05:49.821'
      u: Did not the Polish subjects have a diplomatic representative, who had undertaken
        to represent the Poles?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:05:49.821'
      end: '00:05:54.314'
      u: In Germany—nobody. Not the Swedish, not the Danish...

    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:05:55.720'
      end: '00:06:28.626'
      u: Nobody to represent us. Officially Sweden was assigned as the one to represent
        us. A few days before our arrest in Berlin, we have heard already about the
        actions against the Polish Jews in the various cities of the Germans provinces,
        Leipzig, Frankfurt. Therefore, we started running in droves to the Swedish
        counsul. Unfortunately, we were not given there any kind of answer, neither
        any kind of papers that we are standing under the protection of the Swedish
        government [pause].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:28.626'

        unfortunately am unable...I am unfortunately unable to tell anything.

      end: '00:07:11.068'
      u: In three blocks, two hundred and fifty people in each block. The youngest
        prisoners were, according to instructions, fifteen years old. In many cases
        the Polish Jews came with their youngest children, fourteen or fifteen years
        old. The oldest were seventy-five or older.

      end: '00:08:03.651'
      u: At the beginning we were together in the block. We did not work. Because
        then the SS was doing the work, and also the indoor service of block elders,
        organized by them. Their work consisted in ‘exterminating’ us day in day out,
        and to eliminate [?] us. They succeeded in this work in a very short time...

      u: A third of our block—similar conditions prevailed also in other blocks—have
        fallen right at the beginning. And...

      start: '00:08:19.004'
      end: '00:08:22.263'
      u: Tell it more specifically...What does it mean they had fallen?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:08:22.263'
      end: '00:08:33.616'
      u: We were given...they have chosen for us various torments, and punishments,
        which were to reduce our number. I shall describe a few of them.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:33.616'
      end: '00:08:35.099'
      u: Indeed, go on.
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:08:35.099'
      end: '00:09:19.827'
      u: It was called...it was called ‘belly recumbence’, lying on the stomach meant
        that we had to lie from four o’clock in the mor-...at daybreak, in the summer,
        September 1939 until five o’clock in the evening, on the belly without moving,
        the hands crossed on the back, the cap, the prisoner’s cap in hand. The hall
        was locked, the doors, the windows, the ventilation. And so at high...in the
        warm month of September 1939, there was no air to breathe. Older people ‘fell’
        as a consequence of it, and one may say just like flies.

      end: '00:09:23.266'
      u: Now tell me, who saw to it that people should lie that way?
    - who: Max Sprecher
      start: '00:09:23.266'
      end: '00:10:33.158'
      u: The block elder, and his assistant the ‘room elder’ paraded all day from
        morning till evening before the block, along the rows of windows, and watched.
        They could ‘recognize’ us because according to instructions we had to hold
        the cap in the crossed hands on the back. If someone would move, so the cap
        would move. And in that they would recognize exactly that one or the other
        was moving. So he would mark down through the window from the outside which
        number, or which place was occupied by the prisoner who was moving, and he
        would come in and administer the punishment prescribed for it by the block-elder.
        The punishment consisted in calling the prisoner to the front, to the first
        row, and the block-elder, the room-elder, block-fuehrer in the uniform of
        the SS alternately belabored the poor prisoner with pieces of wood, pieces
        of iron until the man would break down. Often he right there ‘expired’his
        life. There were...

      u: Germans, who for years have served were years ago sentenced to various lagers
        as criminals, and were later transferred to concentration camps. My block-elder
        bore the number 272 from Sachsenhausen. He was one of the oldest criminals,
        previously punished, in this lager. He was himself a boxer and ‘Ringer’, using
        all his strength to exterminate the Jews.

        in that ‘cowering’. It was fortunate for a Jew if he had a chance to die soon.
        But there were a lot of ‘falling’ people who suffered a day or two until they
        died. In order that these people could get a little bit more air, we usually
        placed them near the door, because through the cracks in the door these gravely
        ill people could get a little bit more air.

        windows were locked. Thus the air there was very bad. It was impossible to
        breathe. So it was very difficult for the block leaders, for the SS, to spend
        all day together with us in this heavy fowl air. So they stayed ordinarily
        outside. So they would come in from time to time during [?] the day, and made
        with us strenuous punitive sports. But as soon as they had spent with us a
        few minutes, it became hard for them to breathe in this heavy air, so they
        stopped, went out, and in an hour or two [then] the whole drill was ‘pigged’
        over again [the whole procedure would start all over again].

        to roll in twos, in threes, that is one lies [corrects himself] rolls underneath
        on the ground, the second rolls over him, and the third rolls over the second.
        You can imagine that in this heavy air, and with these run-down people, they
        nearly crushed each other in the [process of rolling. There was no other way,
        because the block-elders together with the SS were compelling the unconscious
        people, unconscious from suffering, unconscious from the sticking air, and
        unconscious from the hard ‘sport’, which these exhausted [?] people were unable
        to stand. Now there is one thing about it. I have stated that we were placing
        first of all our sick, our gravely sick peoples near the door, so these people
        may have still a bit of air in their last hours of life. This by and by was
        noticed by the SS and the block-elders from outside, and they compelled [us]...so
        when they came in, they soon gave a command to roll, with the intent that
        we should roll above these gravely sick people, who were in part in coma [?]
        and so lead them into death. In the first [starting] row were lying a row
        of very young and well ‘sportly’ developed [physically strong] people. As
        soon as we heard the slightest motion in the vestibule, we instantly jumped
        back a half a meter. So when the command would come: ‘roll’, we would roll,
        but not over the sick but only one over the other, over those who were well.
        The aim of the SS [which] was that we ourselves should murder with our own
        bodies our gravely ill [?] brothers, did not materialize.'

      u: 'The other punishments, one could think it a light punishment, were [for
        instance] to lie simply on the stomach. The first day it was still tolerable.
        The second day many arose...many of us arose with torn skin and with blood
        on the chest. It is not as easy to bear for a few hours...to bear tightly
        pressed one against the other, from various...through the various pressures
        from people who were lying in front, behind and on the sides. The pressure,
        and the wounds were so acute, that after the first or second day we all had
        bleeding wounds. The hand was torn and it was bleeding like from a water main.
        At that there also occurred cases when particularly privileged [?] SS were
        looking for some special enjoyments. I shall describe one of them. There entered
        six inebriated SS. They had in their hands various pieces of wood, pieces
        of iron, and thick pieces of rubber hose. The title of the play was called
        that day ‘blood bath.’ A ‘blood bath’ consisted in the following: We had to
        line up in one row. Each SS man was given a row which he was to ‘belabor’.
        And he was beating over the face, over the eyes, over the nose, over the mouth
        until blood started flowing. When blood begins to flow a human grabs instinctively
        with his hand the bleeding wound, as if to stop the bleeding. In that moment
        would come the command: stand still. We were prohibited to move our hands,
        and the blood was flowing down to the ground. And in front of every person
        was formed a little puddle of blood. And so, since we were standing still,
        due to this standing the blood too stood still. So there came the command:
        ‘motion’, or, ‘lie down.’ Through the motion, and lying down with an open
        wound, the blood gushed, flowed again. When there was enough blood for each
        row, there came the command to lie down and to ‘roll’ in it with the face.
        Then we had to get up and all our faces were red from the blood. The SS was
        satisfied and the program for that day was completed. [Pause].'

        which they have found on Jewish prisoners, which were brought in, that it
        is a great holiday for the Jews. And then they invented a special procedure:

        You know...we knew it from the fact, that from the moment the door would open and there would enter the block-elder or SS people, they would soon call: ‘You, fat Jew, come here.’ and although there were several Jews who were stout,—and most of them have perished too—they used [word not clear] however to club and beat this [particular] Jew, until he was ‘completed.’ This was a linguistic designation in the concentration camp: ‘completing’ meant to torture until the man died. On the eighth day he had not a single healthy spot, not a single healthy centimeter on his body. It was all covered and swollen with blood. I still remember the last night. This pious person recited on the top of his voice the Vida [the prayer for those about to die] and the whole block, whether young or old, joined in the weeping and chanting. In the middle of the night the man had the fortune to die. He fell in a very deep stupor, and in the stupor he tore off all his clothes. And in the morning when we sat up he was lying dead, naked, and around him, like, just like during all the last days, was the blood-[soaked] red straw mattress [paillasse]. During the last few days we were laying that man, since the man had numerous open wounds, on the same straw mattress. On the same day it happened that just by accident the lager fuehrer passed through [the block]. He never used to take an interest in our block, because his interest was limited to the daily report on the conditions and to the mortality report. The first greeting which was dealt out to us the first days in the lager, when we were aroused at three, three thirty in the morning was: ‘How many dead are there today?’ Not a ‘Good morning’, not a, ‘Get up’, only ‘How many dead are there today?’ And everyone who would ascertain that his neighbor was cold, reported: ‘Here is one; here is one more.’ And so he would compose his memo [?], his death-report, and with it he would run to the office. His interest in the run of the camp was satisfied for a while with it. And so, there was no interest on the part of the SS, of the lager management, to ascertain how our block looks from the inside. And as said before, by accident it happened that the lager
                            fuehrer just came into the block on that particular day. Then saw...

There were arriving frequently various commissions, domestic and foreign, and [so] they terminated the annihilation method, so that they themselves should not disgrace themselves before a foreign commission which could appear sometime unexpectedly and discover such a fact.

Because the concentration camp Sachsenhausen as well as Meugane [?], Buchenwald, and Dachau consisted only of male prisoners. The transport consisted then only of Jewish prisoners, because, as I mentioned, it was decided at that time to send all the Jewish prisoners to the concentration camps pertaining to Auschwitz.

But I had no strength to march the fifty meters from the lager to the lumber yard together with the detail. And so the guards, the accompanying SS guards did not want to take me with them, and so the laundry detail was chosen for me [located] in the lager
                            Auschwitz proper. And so I had to go only to the next block, from the block where I lived to the next block where the laundry was located. The laundry washed the prisoners’ clothing. Prisoners’...

        I went then with the construction detail from Auschwitz to Birkenau. Birkenau was three kilometers away from Auschwitz, the place [Birkenau] where there were located the five crematories. Our detail worked in various places. In the prisoners’ lager, in the SS
                            lager, in the service buildings. As clerk I got around everywhere, also in the crematories.

        stand in] the lager. The details are standing in groups. At the head of each
        detail stands a capo [trusty] who leads his detail through the gate. At the
        gate sits the Jewish orchestra and plays. That was so ordered, established
        a few years back in the concentration camps in Austria, in Germany proper.
        Subsequently it was taken over by the concentration camps in the East at the
        borders between Germany and Poland, in Silesia, and, for example, in Auschwitz
        and the many sub-lagers near Auschwitz. All at once there came an order that
        the labor details which were about to leave the lager should step back. Each
        one back to his block. The reason was that a very large transport of Jewish
        prisoners [synonymous repetion] of Jewish prisoners had arrived from Hungary
        [Footnote: The deportation of the Jews from Hungary represents a special chaper,
        and is allegedly interwoven with the tragic fate of the Gypsies. There are
        also substantial repercussions at present (Summer 1955) in Israel connected
        with the Hungarian deportations. —D.P.B.] Since the transport was very large,
        they had to be led simultaneously to all five crematories. There arrived a
        hundred RR-cars, and each was packed with a hundred to a hundred and twenty
        prisoners. And so the whole road was a mass of moving, newly arrived Jews
        from Hungary, and [so] we had no room to get through to our work. Only after
        the Jewish prisoners from Hungary were led through on the way to the crematory
        were able to pass to work. And while these Jewish prisoners from Hungary marched
        to the crematory there was sitting in every lager a prisoners’ orchestra and
        played — played the tunes which the SS had selected. Many cheerful Viennese
        tunes, other tunes, at the wish of the SS were played while the Jews were
        approaching step by step each one to his creamtory. [Pause]. There was a case.
        I was going one morning to the crematory two. Crematory one and two. There
        it was arranged that the gas chambers were underground. The crematories three
        and four were set so that the gas chambers were above ground. In both, in
        the four crematories were working hundreds of Jewish prisoners.'

        us where our parents are? We have arrived here last night, together with our
        parents and we have lost them. We slept the night here below in the ditch.
        I knew where the parents were, but I could not reply to the children. Moreover,
        I was unable to give the children an answer, because at that instant there
        approaced us from the other side one of the SS men who were working in the
        lager. In passing at a distance he heard the question which the children have

Besides we prepared a number of various acts, which consisted of the following. We organized groups to escape from the lager and we supplied them with books from the crematory with names in the hope that if not all, so a part will get through, and the names of the fallen people will get out and remain in existence for the world. We also made attempts to make contact with the [a long pause; it seems that at times the revival of memories was so realistic that even a year after liberation people were hesistant to talk about ‘illegal’ acts perpetrated in the camps against the Nazis]...with the partisans who were active there in that region. We did not succeed in it completely. The contact was made at a time when the partisans started ‘working’...executing their underground [?] work in the environs of our lager. There came on the 18th of January ’45 the evacuation of the lager. What we have accomplished was that a part of the prisoners, Poles [Christians], sympathizers of radical leftist movements, who had escaped from the lager have joined in a short time the partisan movement of the region, have attacked the lager in Bodi [?], and during the shooting fell two former prisoners of the lager

        involved in social [community] work before we got into the [KZ] camp, and
        the first thing we considered appropriate after getting out of the [KZ] camp,
        to do some community work for the Jews. And the most important work consisted
        in leading again these declassed, broken-up people toward productive, normal
        work. And that consists...

        been built here were not built by ORT. They were built by a small group of

        in [I have come to] Germany and am continuing now. I am precisely now just
        after my physicum examinations [these cover the first half of the medical
        curriculum] after the interuption. A part of my physicum examinations I passed
        eight years ago in Berlin and the remaining part I passed last week in Heidelberg.

      u: And this quota for foreigners is not being filled by people from among the
        DPs. It is being filled in part with people who came here from various countries,
        especially from the Baltic countries, and the predominant number of students
        at the universities are from these previous inhabitants of the Baltic states
        who are concentrated here in very large numbers.

      u: The attitude may be in general characterized as courteous but...but not frank.
        Because we...because it is a fact that those students who are studying now,
        in a large part had the opportunity to conclude their prepatory training [Gymnasium]
        or to be educated in German universities due to special contacts, or special
        services in the activities of the National Socialist Party. Even if it is
        not possible to prove it against one or another, it does not mean that he
        did not belong [to the Nazi party], it simply has not been proved to date
        that he did belong. And we have developed a fifth sense [obviously sixth sense]
        in the lager. And that sense is called instinct.

        not a falsifier of our instinct. There are among them officers of the German
        Army, there are among them many people who feel themselves nowdays insecure
        in Lithuania. There are gradually returning Jews who recognize [them because
        of] their previous activities. There are returning other inhabitants of Lithuania,
        who have not compromised [involved] themselves with the Germans, and out of
        fear of these Jews, and of those inhabitants of the Baltic States who are
        now returning home, they hold it appropriate [prudent, safe] to abandon their
        countries and to come here.

        have to pay for 250 marks about $25.00 in American currency, while a carton

      u: There is a way, not a nice one, but we had to tread on it. The things which
        we were getting we had to convert into money through people who occupy themselves
        professionally with swindle, trading, and black marketing, so we should be
        able to pay the semester’s tuition. Otherwise, we were informed, we were threatened
        with loss, of the semester. And while others may be able to afford to lose
        semesters, we with the many years [lost] in the lager, who have gotten old
        not studying—we cannot afford such luxury.

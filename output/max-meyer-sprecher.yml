      u: "[In English] Germany, September the 12th [23rd], 1946. Feldafing about 30
        kilometers from Munich, a camp for displaced...a camp for displaced Jews covering
        about forty-five hundred people. Part of the camp is located [?] in a form
        of barracks of the Hitler Youth. I am having a room here in one...I am having
        a room here in one, and the floors are [here] what they call in German parquet,
        fine [inlaid] hardwood floors. The illumination,, although the tension of
        the current is weak, is in very fine armatures [fixtures.] There is central
        heating. There was an interruption...A large field, practically a city of
        barracks and barracks and barracks all over. All are occupied by displaced
        Jews, but I see a number of temporary buildings, private buildings. I am also
        told that several hundred families are billeted in German homes. That is of
        course a rather interesting, rare situation, and the Germans are being forced
        to find decent location for people with [DPs] families. These people are not
        fed by the camp. They have food ration cards and live on their money. What
        kind of money? — Well some [of them] managed to bring something [possibly
        post-armistice refugees from Poland, etc.] Some probably receive it from the
        States, and South America, and Africa. And the black market also helps."

        since the Jews who were lead there did not want voluntarily to cross the border,
        the field, they were surrounded by German police with machine guns, and they
        were chased and compelled to cross the green field into Poland. For Germany
        we were Polish citizens. For Poland we were not Polish citizens. Therefore,
        we were interned in the Polish border city Bedzin, Zbolshin[?] in Polish,
        and remained there a very long time, almost three quarters of a year.

        the German government, that a part of the people should be enabled to return
        and take with them the most necessary things, which they had left behind in
        Germany. Because the major part of the people had come simply...had brought
        with them only what they had...what they were wearing on their bodies, nothing
        else. A part returned in order to arrange their immigration into other lands.
        In this case I returned with the intention [the word is in Hebrew].

        in that ‘cowering’. It was fortunate for a Jew if he had a chance to die soon.
        But there were a lot of ‘falling’ people who suffered a day or two until they
        died. In order that these people could get a little bit more air, we usually
        placed them near the door, because through the cracks in the door these gravely
        ill people could get a little bit more air.

        You can imagine that in this heavy air, and with these run-down people, they
        nearly crushed each other in the [process of rolling. There was no other way,
        because the block-elders together with the SS were compelling the unconscious
        people, unconscious from suffering, unconscious from the sticking air, and
        unconscious from the hard ‘sport’, which these exhausted [?] people were unable
        to stand. Now there is one thing about it. I have stated that we were placing
        first of all our sick, our gravely sick peoples near the door, so these people
        may have still a bit of air in their last hours of life. This by and by was
        noticed by the SS and the block-elders from outside, and they compelled [us]...so
        when they came in, they soon gave a command to roll, with the intent that
        we should roll above these gravely sick people, who were in part in coma [?]
        and so lead them into death. In the first [starting] row were lying a row
        of very young and well ‘sportly’ developed [physically strong] people. As
        soon as we heard the slightest motion in the vestibule, we instantly jumped
        back a half a meter. So when the command would come: ‘roll’, we would roll,
        but not over the sick but only one over the other, over those who were well.
        The aim of the SS [which] was that we ourselves should murder with our own
        bodies our gravely ill [?] brothers, did not materialize.'

        instance] to lie simply on the stomach. The first day it was still tolerable.
        The second day many arose...many of us arose with torn skin and with blood
        on the chest. It is not as easy to bear for a few hours...to bear tightly
        pressed one against the other, from various...through the various pressures
        from people who were lying in front, behind and on the sides. The pressure,
        and the wounds were so acute, that after the first or second day we all had
        bleeding wounds. The hand was torn and it was bleeding like from a water main.
        At that there also occurred cases when particularly privileged [?] SS were
        looking for some special enjoyments. I shall describe one of them. There entered
        six inebriated SS. They had in their hands various pieces of wood, pieces
        of iron, and thick pieces of rubber hose. The title of the play was called
        that day ‘blood bath.’ A ‘blood bath’ consisted in the following: We had to
        line up in one row. Each SS man was given a row which he was to ‘belabor’.
        And he was beating over the face, over the eyes, over the nose, over the mouth
        until blood started flowing. When blood begins to flow a human grabs instinctively
        with his hand the bleeding wound, as if to stop the bleeding. In that moment
        would come the command: stand still. We were prohibited to move our hands,
        and the blood was flowing down to the ground. And in front of every person
        was formed a little puddle of blood. And so, since we were standing still,
        due to this standing the blood too stood still. So there came the command:
        ‘motion’, or, ‘lie down.’ Through the motion, and lying down with an open
        wound, the blood gushed, flowed again. When there was enough blood for each
        row, there came the command to lie down and to ‘roll’ in it with the face.
        Then we had to get up and all our faces were red from the blood. The SS was
        satisfied and the program for that day was completed. [Pause].'

        You know...we knew it from the fact, that from the moment the door would open and there would enter the block-elder or SS people, they would soon call: ‘You, fat Jew, come here.’ and although there were several Jews who were stout,—and most of them have perished too—they used [word not clear] however to club and beat this [particular] Jew, until he was ‘completed.’ This was a linguistic designation in the concentration camp: ‘completing’ meant to torture until the man died. On the eighth day he had not a single healthy spot, not a single healthy centimeter on his body. It was all covered and swollen with blood. I still remember the last night. This pious person recited on the top of his voice the Vida [the prayer for those about to die] and the whole block, whether young or old, joined in the weeping and chanting. In the middle of the night the man had the fortune to die. He fell in a very deep stupor, and in the stupor he tore off all his clothes. And in the morning when we sat up he was lying dead, naked, and around him, like, just like during all the last days, was the blood-[soaked] red straw mattress [paillasse]. During the last few days we were laying that man, since the man had numerous open wounds, on the same straw mattress. On the same day it happened that just by accident the lager fuehrer passed through [the block]. He never used to take an interest in our block, because his interest was limited to the daily report on the conditions and to the mortality report. The first greeting which was dealt out to us the first days in the lager, when we were aroused at three, three thirty in the morning was: ‘How many dead are there today?’ Not a ‘Good morning’, not a, ‘Get up’, only ‘How many dead are there today?’ And everyone who would ascertain that his neighbor was cold, reported: ‘Here is one; here is one more.’ And so he would compose his memo [?], his death-report, and with it he would run to the office. His interest in the run of the camp was satisfied for a while with it. And so, there was no interest on the part of the SS, of the lager management, to ascertain how our block looks from the inside. And as said before, by accident it happened that the lager
                            fuehrer just came into the block on that particular day. Then saw...

It was done for a completely different reason. Sachsenhausen was located near Berlin. There were arriving frequently various commissions, domestic and foreign, and [so] they terminated the annihilation method, so that they themselves should not disgrace themselves before a foreign commission which could appear sometime unexpectedly and discover such a fact. They then changed to other means in order to continue to annihilate us in an effective, silent invisible manner. A few things.

The same day our things were taken away from us. Even in a lager one may have a relationship to his own things [an ‘attitude’ towards one’s own things], even to prisoners’ things. There were things that gave a certain [amount of warmth]. It was already autumn and warm things were of importance. [Same whisper] In the preparations for the transport, our warm things were taken away and we were given light summer things. This way the prisoners were usually dressed, when they were led to the ‘industrial’ yard, near the lager
                            Sachsenhausen to be shot. And [therefore] we all were sure that we are not lead to transport but that we shall be shot at night in the large square at the ‘industrial’ yard of the lager...of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen.

        We were transported in freight [?] cars, seventy to eighty prisoners in one car. We arrived a protracted journey in Auschwitz. Men only. Because the concentration camp Sachsenhausen as well as Meugane [?], Buchenwald, and Dachau consisted only of male prisoners. The transport consisted then only of Jewish prisoners, because, as I mentioned, it was decided at that time to send all the Jewish prisoners to the concentration camps pertaining to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz we immediately presented ourselves for a transport to the Buna industries. We presented ourselves so that we should not have to wait [to idle], to vegetate in that horrible lager
                            Auschwitz. Buna was called Auschwitz II [two], a small lager annex, near Auswitz. It was small in terms of a lager for prisoners, but it was to be built up into the largest industrial project of the I.G. FARBEN industry of that region. It was already in our time a conglomeration of a thousand interconnected factories. Each factory occupied a few dozen [tens]...it was planned that each factory should occupy a few hundred [?] prisoners. The whole project Buna

        detail stands a capo [trusty] who leads his detail through the gate. At the
        gate sits the Jewish orchestra and plays. That was so ordered, established
        a few years back in the concentration camps in Austria, in Germany proper.
        Subsequently it was taken over by the concentration camps in the East at the
        borders between Germany and Poland, in Silesia, and, for example, in Auschwitz
        and the many sub-lagers near Auschwitz. All at once there came an order that
        the labor details which were about to leave the lager should step back. Each
        one back to his block. The reason was that a very large transport of Jewish
        prisoners [synonymous repetion] of Jewish prisoners had arrived from Hungary
        [Footnote: The deportation of the Jews from Hungary represents a special chaper,
        and is allegedly interwoven with the tragic fate of the Gypsies. There are
        also substantial repercussions at present (Summer 1955) in Israel connected
        with the Hungarian deportations. —D.P.B.] Since the transport was very large,
        they had to be led simultaneously to all five crematories. There arrived a
        hundred RR-cars, and each was packed with a hundred to a hundred and twenty
        prisoners. And so the whole road was a mass of moving, newly arrived Jews
        from Hungary, and [so] we had no room to get through to our work. Only after
        the Jewish prisoners from Hungary were led through on the way to the crematory
        were able to pass to work. And while these Jewish prisoners from Hungary marched
        to the crematory there was sitting in every lager a prisoners’ orchestra and
        played — played the tunes which the SS had selected. Many cheerful Viennese
        tunes, other tunes, at the wish of the SS were played while the Jews were
        approaching step by step each one to his creamtory. [Pause]. There was a case.
        I was going one morning to the crematory two. Crematory one and two. There
        it was arranged that the gas chambers were underground. The crematories three
        and four were set so that the gas chambers were above ground. In both, in
        the four crematories were working hundreds of Jewish prisoners.'

        were children from Budapest and spoke freely a good German—could you tell
        us where our parents are? We have arrived here last night, together with our
        parents and we have lost them. We slept the night here below in the ditch.
        I knew where the parents were, but I could not reply to the children. Moreover,
        I was unable to give the children an answer, because at that instant there
        approaced us from the other side one of the SS men who were working in the
        lager. In passing at a distance he heard the question which the children have
        asked me. I went on, as if I have heard nothing, as if they have not spoken
        to me. He went over to the children and spoke to them: ‘Come children, I take

Besides we prepared a number of various acts, which consisted of the following. We organized groups to escape from the lager and we supplied them with books from the crematory with names in the hope that if not all, so a part will get through, and the names of the fallen people will get out and remain in existence for the world. We also made attempts to make contact with the [a long pause; it seems that at times the revival of memories was so realistic that even a year after liberation people were hesistant to talk about ‘illegal’ acts perpetrated in the camps against the Nazis]...with the partisans who were active there in that region. We did not succeed in it completely. The contact was made at a time when the partisans started ‘working’...executing their underground [?] work in the environs of our lager. There came on the 18th of January ’45 the evacuation of the lager. What we have accomplished was that a part of the prisoners, Poles [Christians], sympathizers of radical leftist movements, who had escaped from the lager have joined in a short time the partisan movement of the region, have attacked the lager in Bodi [?], and during the shooting fell two former prisoners of the lager

      u: This concludes spool 9-45A. An interview with Mr. Fenger in English, an instructor
        in the new formed—or newly formed—navigation school which had its branches
        in Paris. It was the Zebulon school. And in France and, I understand even
        in England. Chicago, November the 14th 1950, Boder. This concludes Spool 9-45A
        and eh,...on another spool we have 9-45B the beginning of the interview with
        Mr. Bramson in Russian.

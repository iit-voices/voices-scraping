      u: "[In English] Spool 9-45A and 9-45B. It had some irrelevant material on the
        start. Possibly in duplication a, um...previously used wire was used again.
        The spool is for the time being 9-45A, containing the...interview with a...Polish,
        English-speaking marine, who trains Jewish sailors and fisherman, and 9-45B
        the beginning of the interview with Mr. Bramson at the ORT school. There is
        some other irrelevant material on the spool—apparently the apparatus, how
        it often happened was demonstrated to some visitors at the place of interview
        before privacy could be obtained with the actual interviewee."

        Today it is part of Belarus. Between the two wars, anti-Semitism and the economic
        downturn caused by the Great Depression led to large scale Jewish emigration
        from Pinsk.2

    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:36.939'
      end: '00:02:41.486'
      u: Then your parents had moved from Pinsk to France.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:02:41.486'
      end: '00:02:48.405'
      u: From Pinsk they came...from Russia they came to Pinsk, from Pinsk to Poland;
        that was during the Russian revolution, in Russia.

      end: '00:03:10.678'
      u: Yes. Underwear and various other small things. Just like all other Jews started
        to make a living.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:10.678'

      end: '00:03:16.189'
      u: Oh, Now, go on. Tell us.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:03:16.189'
      end: '00:03:18.784'
      u: They have come in the year, —‘40. They occupied Paris.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:18.784'
      end: '00:03:19.096'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:03:19.096'
      end: '00:03:32.478'
      u: And so about a year or six months passed, and my brother was arrested. He
        was then 26 years old.Henja’s brother was most probably arrested in round-up
        of foreign born Jewish males in Paris in August 1941.3
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:32.478'
      end: '00:03:33.837'
      u: Why was he arrested?

      start: '00:03:33.837'
      end: '00:04:01.407'
      u: He was riding to work on a bicycle, and on the way he sees a big raid. The
        French had erected a barricade, and people were being arrested. He was riding
        to work, and he noticed that it was not exactly safe. So he turned back to
        the house to tell my father and my younger brother that they should not leave
        the house.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:01.407'
      end: '00:04:06.088'
      u: Where was your older brother? Oh yes, that was your older brother.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:04:06.088'
      end: '00:04:08.682'
      u: That was the older brother.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:08.682'
      end: '00:04:15.667'
      u: Well, so what happened then?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:04:15.667'
      end: '00:04:44.205'
      u: While he was riding homeward, he was stopped. They requested his papers,
        and he was what they call in France a engagé volontaire, that is, he had enlisted
        in the army voluntarily when the war started. But that did not count. he was
        taken away to Drancy.
    - who: David Boder

      end: '00:04:48.620'

      start: '00:04:48.620'
      end: '00:04:49.511'
      u: Against the Germans.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:49.511'
      end: '00:04:53.574'
      u: And then he was arrested by the French when the Germans were here?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:04:53.574'
      end: '00:04:55.382'
      u: When the Germans were here,
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:55.382'
      end: '00:04:59.428'
      u: yes. So that didn’t count that he was—nothing counted.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:04:59.428'
      end: '00:05:08.132'
      u: They saw his name was Frydman, they saw that he was Jewish, and they did
        not look any further at his paper.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:08.132'
      end: '00:05:12.420'
      u: At that time, it was already compulsory to wear the star of David?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:05:12.420'
      end: '00:05:15.639'
      u: No, at that time the star of David was not yet worn.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:15.639'
      end: '00:05:18.295'
      u: So they sent him where to?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:05:18.295'
      end: '00:05:22.358'
      u: They sent him away to the first lager in Paris. Drancy.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:22.358'
      end: '00:05:24.499'
      u: Drancy, Yes.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:05:24.499'
      end: '00:05:29.952'
      u: and [here a few words are incomprehensible; she apparently weeps.]
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:29.952'
      end: '00:05:31.827'
      u: And from there did you hear from him?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:05:31.827'
      end: '00:06:52.859'
      u: At the beginning we had no news from there. What was going on at home one
        can imagine. The mother [a long pause], she didn’t know what to do. I went
        into the streets [one word not clear] to investigate what exactly was happening.
        I saw that they were taking all the men, the Jewish ones in the oldest district
        of Paris. That really was the second time [the second raid] because already
        a year ago they were taking people from Pithiviers. And then the life started
        in our home like in so many Jewish homes—one was already missing. In time
        we got word about happenings in Drancy. People yelled because they have no
        food. They have nothing to sleep on. It is dirty, and many people die from
        diarrhea and dysentery. The discipline in the lager was very strict. I shall
        not describe it.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:52.859'
      end: '00:07:03.528'
      u: Why not? Tell us; we want to know all about it. Do not skip. These things
        you have heard from other people?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:07:03.528'
      end: '00:07:13.260'
      u: No. I did not hear it from other people. Because in a short time, in spite
        of the orders of the Germans and of the French, I managed to get into Drancy.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:13.260'
      end: '00:07:18.776'
      u: Then let’s wait with it a bit. First tell me again. Your brother was in Drancy,
        and then?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:07:18.776'
      end: '00:07:22.780'
      u: For three months we had no word from him.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:22.780'
      end: '00:07:24.806'
      u: Could you send him food?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:07:24.806'
      end: '00:07:44.049'
      u: No. For the first three months it was prohibited to send food. There was
        just nothing we could do to help our own in the lager. We had to suffer through
        these months just as it was.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:44.049'
      end: '00:07:46.768'
      u: Well, what happened then?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:07:46.768'
      end: '00:08:48.739'
      u: After three months they started writing. One post-card with a few words in
        which he said, I am in Drancy, I am well, and nothing more. They didn’t have
        to write because we heard already what was going on in that lager from the
        inhabitants of Drancy [meaning in this case apparently the suburb of Drancy
        itself]. They themselves tried to help the people, because they could not
        stand the screams, “I am hungry, I am hungry.” That they heard all day. For
        the first time in many years people experienced real starvation. They began
        to understand what German rule means, what it means to have the Germans in
        France, for the Jews. [A long pause] It is hard for me to describe these misfortunes.Drancy
        was administered by the French from August 21,1941 to July 1, 1943, after
        which it was run by the Germans until August 17, 1944. The collaborationist
        Vichy regime greatly facilitated German rule in France.4
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:48.739'
      end: '00:08:49.661'
      u: Why?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:08:49.661'
      end: '00:08:56.913'
      u: Because after this misfortune there came other catastropnes. And worse than
        the other.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:56.913'
      end: '00:09:18.593'
      u: Well, you understand how important it is that these events be described.
        It is hard for you to talk. It is hard for me to listen but it has to be done.
        You understand. Go on as well as you can.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:09:18.593'
      end: '00:09:39.575'
      u: In three months a lot of people already started to die. The Germans gave
        an order that they pick out the young ones up to the age of twenty-five who
        were in a bad state.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:39.575'
      end: '00:09:39.575'
      u: What does that mean?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:09:39.575'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: In a bad condition.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:09:42.599'
      u: To set them free?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:09:42.599'
      end: '00:09:47.438'
      u: Yes. Only those up to the age of twenty-five who are in a bad condition.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:47.438'
      end: '00:09:47.985'
      u: Yes.

      start: '00:09:47.985'
      end: '00:10:03.493'
      u: We started then to hope that our brother would get out. He was twenty-six
        years old. I went again to Drancy and saw the people who were released.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:10:03.493'
      end: '00:10:07.416'
      u: Had you been to Drancy once before?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:10:07.416'
      end: '00:10:18.587'
      u: I was here already before. But I couldn’t see him, because they were not
        permitted to show their faces. And we couldn’t see them.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:10:18.587'
      end: '00:10:25.537'
      u: Could you please describe the place of Drancy where they were kept?
    - who: Henja Frydman

        she would speak German. Her German was rather ungrammatical but fluent. During
        the interview she does not call her dialect German but Yiddish. Here we have
        the peculiar language pattern so frequently found among the DPs. First Yiddish-Russian,
        then French, then German, then French again. The consequences for mental health
        and personality adjustment of such forced changes of linguistic behavior,
        most frequently under duress, with but little or no scholastic aid, have hardly
        been explored.]The language pattern noted here by Boder might have been linked
        to the stress experienced by the interviewees in recalling their traumatic
        experiences, the tension caused by the interview process, and the time interviewees
        spent with persecuted victims of other nationalities.5'

        older. The number of the released was very small. I was waiting all day, and
        before my eyes there came out corpses, just corpses. I was sixteen years old,
        and for the first time before my eyes marched dead people. I have never before
        in my life seen a corpse.

        None humans. It was grotesque. Two legs, two hands they had, but no face of
        a normal person. The families came and those who were able to recognize their
        own—because not always could they be recognized—only a few recognized them,
        and they took them home and their joy was great. And the mourning of those
        whose own remained in the lager was also very great.

      u: A large number died at home, because if a mother got back her child, he was
        given his ration, and he being very hungry threw himself at the food, and
        they would get sick, and they would not adjust to the change.This is precisely
        what occurred immediately after the liberation of the concentration camps.
        Many of the newly freed inmates became sick and died due to the effects of
        the sudden change in diet, which their weakened bodies could not handle.6

        and the people who remained in Drancy remained there. Conditions improved
        there a little bit. We were allowed to send packages to the lager, and it
        is superfluous to say that everyone, the families who didn’t have enough for
        themselves, sent whatever they could to their own in the lager. People started
        to get letters. Not in the legal way. In an illegal way. And my brother wrote
        that we should not worry about him. Nothing would happen.

        He wanted to give hope to the family. But he was intelligent enough not to
        expect anything. People talked already about deportations. To be shipped away,
        one did not know where. And it was. All at once we got a letter. [A long pause—here
        apparently she weeps. Her silent weeping now goes over into sobs.] And my
        brother was being deported. [A long pause. Again Miss Frydman continues in
        tears.] The mourning at home was great.The emotions Henja experienced here
        and elsewhere when talking about her family illustrates how attached she was

        Auschwitz in 1942, that my brother fell, that he got sick with typhus, and
        died immediately afterwards. In 1942 it was impossible to overcome an illness
        in Auschwitz because there was no hospital; there was no nothing. There were
        only Germans, just to kill the people, not to let them live. Only by miracle
        some people survived, from the year 1942, because in 1942 Auschwitz was not
        a work lager, but Auschwitz was—and it was written so on a sign—an extermination
        lager.In 1942 Auschwitz was in fact both a concentration and extermination
        camp, and remained so until the fall of 1944 when Heinrich Himmler ordered
        the dismantling of its gas chambers and crematoria. Subsequently, of course,
        inmates continued to die from other causes. The sign Henja is referring to
        might have been the cynical, ironic sign, “Arbeit Macht Frei” (“Work Sets
        You Free”).8

        eighteen to twenty—twenty-three—twenty-five years of age. We found it out
        from a French policeman. We should not remain at home. Informed that only
        the young would be taken, my parents said that I should hide with a French
        girl friend with whom I went to school. And so I did, and my brother was also
        to go away to one of his friends. And so—that was—I really can’t tell you

        My parents remained at home. And I did not believe that they would take only
        the young. My suspicions were correct. At night they came to our home, as
        to all Jewish homes, to take my father and my mother. Right the next morning
        when I heard the news that in all Paris they had taken the Jews, I immediately
        took a bus and went home to ask the neighbors, the people who lived around,
        what has happened to my parents. Nobody was able to tell. From house to house,
        from acquaintance to acquaintance. I found out that the police had come at
        night, and they said that they were going up to the second floor to another
        Jewish tenant, and so my father and mother and brother got out of the house
        and disappeared in the night. They got away and came to acquaintances who
        were French, Jewish-French; and there they hid because in those times they
        did not take yet French Jews. I found out about it, and I came to them. And
        the scene at the moment shall also not be described. One can’t imagine it.
        A child that has thought that her parents were already in the hands of the
        Germans, and she sees that they are not yet fallen into their hands. Three
        months my parents were hiding with those Jews and lived in terror. They could
        not leave the house. Neither could they work.

      u: The Resistance was formed through small groups of young people, who belonged
        to various clubs. Sport clubs managed to get together. At school they also
        had talks among themselves. In my group we made a Jewish section, because
        Jews had other methods of action. They could not move around freely, and at
        first could not do the same things as the others, because to supply them with
        false identification papers was not a matter of one day. So it was a section
        of the Resistance. It wasn’t the business of one day to manage the papers.
        So we had to find a place to live till the false papers were arranged, and
        that was not easy. In a few months, in three months, we started working with
        the French cells. Just like the French. A number of us became French Partisans.
        Partisans you have heard about. Many of us worked in propaganda. Others of
        us worked in solidarity units, that is, to help the mothers who had remained
        with children. And many of us were arrested in a short time but that could
        not scare us; we went on with our work. It is understood that in spite of
        the fact that we were in the Resistance, we had different viewpoints. The
        groups originated not only in sport groups, but also there were various political
        groups. I belonged to the Communist youth.The French communist resistance
        movement was energized by the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June
        21, 1941 and the abrogation of the Stalin-Hitler Pact. Although Henja was
        at first in a specifically Jewish section of the communist resistance (which
        contained a number of Polish-born Jews), she indicates that her section later
        merged with the general communist resistance movement. The acronym for the
        military branch of the communist resistance was FTP-MOI.11

      u: Only against the Germans. And secondly, a Jew in general should not move
        for the Germans even a finger because that was his greatest enemy in the world.
        He had a task to destroy them. Not for them, but against them, he had to take
        his position. That is what I told my father. My parents were already old,
        about fifty-six, and of course they could not share my views. They feared
        for their daughter and they thought that if she would live with them she would
        be at home and could be protected by a [work] certificate. She would be able
        to leave the terrible conditions, so to speak, in which we all found ourselves.
        I couldn’t say that my father worked for the Germans. No. He did not work
        for them. Through his connections he got a certificate. My brother was working,
        like many young people, in a factory which previously was a factory of fur
        jackets. But the difference was that [now] the fur jackets were going to Germany,
        whether we cared to know or not. That was the situation. I did not return
        home and so I got torn away from my parents. In the nine months, the time
        I was separated from my parents, I was only coming to see them from time to
        time, because it was impossible to visit them often. The police on the streets
        were very strict. They questioned one for his papers.

        card the belief that this would proyect him. But it would not. One was taking
        a risk. One day I went for a meeting with comrades of my party and of the

      u: Person. The problem was about my parents.Family solidarity helped those persecuted
        maintain their morale, but it also inhibited active resistance. Young adult
        children were concerned about their parents and wanted to protect and shelter
        them as much as they could, rather than undertaking risky actions against
        the enemy. Later in the interview, Henja reveals that family solidarity inhibited
        escape attempts from the deportation train.12 I was told to leave Paris. I
        did not want to leave Paris, because my parents would have got scared, and
        so I remained in Paris. I hid with a French friend who did not work in the
        Resistance. He knew what I was, who I was, and he hid me for eight days. But
        I couldn’t live in this fashion for long. All my things were in my room. And
        I went back to my place. No good things were waiting for me. But the instinct
        drove me, and I went ahead. Before going up to my room, I asked the concierge—what
        they call them in France, which means—-

      u: The janitress. Yes. ‘Nobody was here to see me?’ She says, ‘No.’It is unclear
        whether or not the concierge knew that the French police were waiting for
        Henja in her room and failed to warn her. It is, however, indisputable that
        Vichy’s anti-Semitic policies could not have been carried out without the
        complicity of countless ordinary French citizens. The official post-war French
        view, which divided French men and women into a majority of heroic resisters
        and a minority of cowardly collaborators, is untrue.13 ‘Are there any letters
        for me?’ She says, ‘No.’ She did not know who I was. She did not know that
        I was Jewish.

        before me three French inspectors, from the special brigade. The special police
        against the political—one can say a second bureau that was composed not of
        people who guard the country.It appears that the inspectors who arrested Henja
        were from the section of the French police designated to investigate political
        subversion rather than the special anti-Jewish police force created by the
        Vichy government. The French police had records which helped in their identification
        of suspects.14

        I laughed from nervousness. I also laughed because I was eighteen years old,
        young, unarmed, and I see three frightened Frenchmen inspectors, who immediately
        sat me down on a chair and started searching my things. The condition in which
        I found my room cannot be described. Everything—from my luggage, my books,
        my notebooks in which I had been writing—everything was thrown around when
        they searched. They tried to find tracts or books. They found nothing in my
        place, because I had enough prudence—

        it, and in spite of the fact that the biography was written in a secret code,
        the still found out my real name, my address. In my biography it was stated
        that my parents did not know that I am working in the party, and when they
        started asking me where were my parents, I told them, ‘I don’t know; I haven’t
        seen my parents for already two years.’ They asked me what I was living from,
        what my occupation was, and one of them held his hand raised, so in case I
        did not answer, he would strike me. I continued laughing. They asked me why
        I laughed. So I told them, ‘I am laughing at you. At your three revolvers
        that are pointed at me. I have nothing.’ They told me to get my things ready,
        to come with them to the station. Then came up the man in charge of the inspectors,
        and he immediately started questioning me, one question after the other, believing
        that he would get out from me immediately the truth. ‘What do you live from,’
        he asked me, ‘Sure you are not a smart girl? ‘You may think what you wish.’

        me because I did not want to talk about my parents. I knew that one word about
        my parents, and they would be taken also. Where from do I have the papers?
        A whole story came to my imagination, and I spun a yarn, a very foolish yarn.
        One did not need, for them, a very smart yarn. I asked the inspectors permission—excuse
        me, but I have to recollect the events. But I want to show you how far the
        French inspectors were already educated—one really can’t say even educated,
        because they had not time to get educated. They were already corrupt. I asked
        his permission to go to the toilet. So one of the inspectors led me all the
        way to the toilet, and he did not close the door. He followed me every step
        and spoke ugly words. For the first time in my life my feminine dignity was
        attacked. I could not imagine that there are in the world such men. They took
        me to the station. I took with me the things I could carry—my winter clothes,
        because I understood that I was to be deported, too. From the station I was
        taken to the bureau, and there were hundreds of inspectors. One after another,
        they interrogated me.

        me anyway, but by accident or by luck they did not beat me. And why? For two
        days, day and night, they were beating my comrades who were arrested before
        me. I was among the last. They were already tired. They had nothing to find
        out, because they knew. And so they left me alone. I slept alone in a room
        in the secret division, as they called it, with six policemen in the room,
        on the table with no blanket, no nothing, no food, although I had no desire
        to eat. Through an inspector, who was—I felt that he was not an enemy, I sent
        a letter to my parents. There again my instinct was sound. He came to my parents
        and gave them the letter. And in the letter I wrote to my parents that [I
        said] I hadn’t seen them for two years in case the police came to question
        them, they should find out that we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.
        And so it was.

        because it is being said that the Jews were hiding and that the Jews did nothing.The
        post-war calumny that the Jewish of France meekly accepted their fate is refuted
        by Henja’s account. Henri Michel, a respected historian of the French resistance,
        estimated that some 25% of the French Jewish community was involved in resistance
        work, a far greater percentage than that of the general population.15

      u: The French. The anti-Semites. And it is being said everywhere. What good
        a Jew does is not being acknowledged. What he does wrong there is a whole
        world to yell about it, and to describe it. They didn’t talk about the sixty
        girls, sixty Jewish girls arrested here in prison. They didn’t tell about
        the women who were beaten naked, and who were starved. They didn’t talk about
        them. Women, mothers of children, worked in the Resistance. Women from the
        Communist party, indeed in large numbers, Communist or not, they worked against
        the Germans. And that is what counts. The faces were unrecognizable, from
        the beatings of the Germans. The sick around us, they were all locked up.
        We spent three weeks in the depot. I received one package from my family,
        a package made by my mother. I wept bitterly. Feeling the sufferings of my
        parents. I thought that I had fulfilled my task as a youth, and as a Jewish
        daughter. From the depot we were sent away—the whole Jewish group. They didn’t
        make a political issue of us. They did not make of our case a question of
        the Resistance. They made of our case a Jewish question. And for Jews there
        was one place, Drancy, and from Drancy—deportation. I came to the same lager
        where my brother was. I even met some men who had lived together with my brother.

        I believe. We spent three months in Drancy. During these three months there
        was no talk about deportation. Before, by the hundreds, people—men, women,
        and children—were already deported from this lager. And we were waiting. We
        knew our turn would come.

      u: Drancy was an armory for men and women. By the time I came to Drancy, there
        were already separate barracks for men and separate barracks for women. Separate
        barracks for foreign [Jews] and separate barracks for French Jews. There were
        also special departments for Aryans. Everything was very nicely classified,
        so that at the time of deportation they would pick out the ones they needed.
        Life had improved in Drancy.After mid-November 1942, the food and general
        living situation at Drancy improved from what they had been at the beginning
        of the camp’s existence with the help of French Jewish organizations.16

        we got was rotten. We did not get anything fresh.

      u: The potatoes were peeled before cooking. The food was no good, but we received
        packages from home. That was permitted, a package a week. Many did not receive
        packages, because there were no more families at home. And we shared with
        those who had no packages. As to food, conditions were good. What does it
        mean, good? It wasn’t like at home, but we didn’t starve. And in comparison
        with the depot and the prefecture, Drancy appeared not too bad. Personally,
        my group, with my group we did not let time pass doing nothing, so that we
        should not become demoralized, because that was the intent of the Germans.
        We read, and we studied, we had among us teachers, and they arranged courses.
        The day passed quickly.Despite difficult conditions, Jewish religious and
        cultural life was maintained at Drancy. Engaging in study, giving moral and
        psychological support, and dancing and singing to lift spirits should be considered
        as forms of resistance. Subsequently, Henja relates that when she and others
        were deported to Drancy they were singing.17

      u: "[Excitedly] Yes, he was executed. There was, of course, a reason to execute
        him. He has sent enough people to their death. And his trial has taken too
        much time, just like all other trials. He was executed.Alois Brunner, one
        of Adolf Eichmann’s chief assistants, assumed command of Drancy on July 2,
        1943. Before coming to Drancy he had helped deport Jews from Vienna, Moravia
        and Greece. Once installed at Drancy, Brunner removed the Vichy-appointed
        camp commander and ran it with the help of SS officers. His rule was characterized
        by a marked deterioration of conditions for the inmates and concerted efforts
        to deport imprisoned Jews to Auschwitz. After the war Brunner disappeared.
        He was not tried at Nuremberg, but was tried in absentia in Paris in 1954
        and sentenced to death. However, he was eventually granted asylum in Syria
        and lived there for many years under an assumed name. Brunner was never brought
        to justice.18 [Footnote: One cannot help observing that the first half of
        the story of Brenner was told in a rather hesitant and phlegmatic way. One
        cannot really be sure whether she is informed of the facts or not. Or is it,
        as in so many cases of DPs, that she really does not want to talk about the
        Germans and whatever happened to them? Only in the second part, when she begins,
        ‘and there was a reason for’ she becomes animated and persuasive.] [After
        a pause] He came, and they prepared lists. Each one was questioned. They did
        not say for what purpose. They were very insistent in asking whether we still
        had families in France, and where these families were, but we were not so
        foolish as to tell about our families. He simply said, ‘Where is your family,
        so that we can send you away together.’This feigned solicitousness towards
        the victims was typical of Nazi deception. Later Henja recounts how upon the
        arrival of her transport at Auschwitz, the SS asked those who were old or
        weak to board trucks which would take them into the camp so they wouldn’t
        have to walk. The trucks went straight to the gas chambers. It is unclear
        who the “he” to whom Henja refers might be.19"

        three days of blockade, very strictly; one couldn’t say a word in the lager.
        The police watched us strictly. We didn’t sleep nights anymore, because we
        knew something was going to happen. There was no deportation for a long time,
        but the moment had come also for us, and so it was. At two o’clock in the
        morning they came into our rooms. They called out our names and told us to
        get ready for deportation.

        Drancy was near Paris, nearer to the family. In spite of that, we didn’t see
        them. But we lived in proximity. And to be deported—possible it was a separation
        forever. We knew it. We were placed in special blocks—those who were assigned
        to be deported, and I was among them. And my whole group. That day our friends

        were so full of terror when they saw us. I have to mention that in our transport
        there were a lot of children, and I also forgot to tell you that when we departed
        for Drancy we were singing.

        with a friend in Twize [??] when I was imprisoned there. It is a Russian melody.
        [She sings two stanzas. The melody which she claims is Russian really consists
        of two songs. The first is a Russian song which starts with the words, “In

      u: Now begins the long chapter of two years imprisonment in Auschwitz. It will
        not be easy for me, indeed, as all of us say when we are asked to tell. To
        tell! That is the hardest thing for us. Why? Because there are no words. No
        way of expressing it, that can describe what happened from the day when we
        disembarked from the train in the lager Auschwitz until the day of our liberation.Henja
        was imprisoned in Auschwitz from the end of June 1943 until her liberation
        by the Red Army on January 27, 1945. Indeed, ordinary language cannot begin
        to convey the horrors of the deepest circle of the Nazi hell or what has been
        called “planet Auschwitz.”22 The liberation of a few hundred deportees from
        Auschwitz. I was almost two years in the lager. I was fortunate enough not
        to be evacuated like the others on the roads, where so many have died, after
        two years of life in the lager. We were lined up five abreast, men on the
        one side, women on the other side. German officers, with a stick in hand,
        with savage outcries which were for us still new, started dividing us up,
        one to the right, one to the left, whichever way it would occur to them. ‘Leave
        your bundles here; you will return presently. We will just count you up.’
        We left our packages, women were separated from men, sisters from brothers,
        women to one side, and the men away to the other side. They then started what
        was called a selection. They asked us who were tired, and they told these
        to step into the trucks which were waiting. They also told us that the old
        people shouldn’t exert themselves by walking on foot, and that they should
        mount the trucks and they would be driven to the lager, and the young ones
        should walk. [The next sentence is not clear.] Out of a transport of fifteen
        hundred people, men, women, and children—a large number were children—we came
        into the lager two hundred and fifty French girls and women, and the rest
        climbed into the trucks, the rest of the women and the older men, also the
        sick, and they told us the trucks go to a second lager. The men were handled
        the same way as we were when we started our march to the lager. Now we enter.
        German soldiers lead us. We assemble on a large square—empty, not a tree grows,
        not a living human being outside—only Germans. And yelling, ‘Fast!’ and ‘Move
        on!’ The words that we already knew well. We looked at each other—to speak
        was prohibited—and we see that we are already trapped good. When one enters
        the lager at the gates, there are flowers, beautiful flowers indeed. And the
        windows are adorned with very beautiful curtains, and you know what these
        curtains were—Thalsisin [prayer shawls]—Jewish prayer shawls for curtains.Prayer
        shawl in Hebrew is Tallit; pl. Tallitot.23 I stared at it—my father used to
        pray every day—and I was thinking, ‘How is it that we see a Thaleis, a Jewish
        Thaleis on these windows—hung up there?’ And that meant a lot. The hanging
        of the prayer shawls meant a lot. We were moved into a barracks, we were locked
        up for all night with no food, no drink. We didn’t have anymore our things.
        They called in girls from the lager, Slovakian girls, Jewish, and they started
        first of all to take off our “fingers” the golden things that one had, watches,
        engagement rings—all that was taken off.

      u: Were you permitted to have that in Drancy?

      start: '01:18:18.140'
      end: '01:20:03.352'
      u: It was not permitted in Drancy, but many women and people had hidden these
        things, and there was no very strict control. Why wasn’t it very strict? Because
        they knew that in Oświęcim they would be taken away. And immediately they
        started to tattoo us. That means to write the number on our hands. Many fainted.
        I personally revived three of my acquaintances. With a pen they wrote the
        numbers on our hands with a special ink—the number which I still have today,
        first, because it won’t come off, and second, because I don’t want to remove
        it.Henja’s decision not to remove the tattoo on her left arm was prompted
        by her desire to bear witness to what she had endured and to remind the world
        of the evils of Nazism. It was the imperative to bear witness which helped
        strengthen her will to live in Auschwitz. But the tattoo was also a painful
        daily reminder of all that she had suffered and all that she had lost.24 The
        number was written on, and hungry, in dirt and in the cold—in spite of the
        fact that it was in the month of June, it is very cold in upper Silesia—we
        lay down to sleep on the ground. One German woman was with us in the barracks,
        and she said that we would have to manage this night, and tomorrow we would
        go into our barracks. That night, the first night, we couldn’t sleep, couldn’t
        believe it was we who lived that way. Lying on the floor, we were frightfully
        tired. One of our friends were insane and was yelling, because things made
        a terrible impression on her. She was in panic.

      u: She was yelling—I don’t remember exactly. All I know is she went insane from
        the transport. She went insane because she left in France a child. From fright,
        we were lying one over the other like animals. Stepping one on the other.
        We finally lived to see the dawn, the day of Auschwitz. That is, the day begins
        at 4:00. A husky German women from those—with a black triangle, which we learned
        afterwards meant a German prostitute, started pushing us around, and led us
        to what was called a shower bath. That is, where people went to bathe. On
        the way to the “zaune” [shower-bath] we had to stand in the lager, on the
        lager street they called it, and it was the hour when the men assembled to
        go to work. And we hear music. A march of death—exactly a march of death.
        We see how men are beaten, and people scream, and men fall, —one cannot call
        them men. They had no more the appearance of men. Frightfully thin, dressed
        in rags, faces full of panic, in tatters, marching five abreast, and singing
        because they were ordered to sing.

      u: German songs. German songs, German marches, that the Germans have taught
        them in the lager. And so we had the first contact with Auschwitz. With clubs
        and with yells we were told to take off all we had on. Naked men worked in
        the zaune, prisoners, and in front of the German men and women undressed,
        naked, and left their things. From above a man and two or three of them looked
        at us; our eyes were fixed on the earth, and we could not believe what was
        happening. First of all, we were taken to the shearing room. Again Slovakian
        girls—why Slovakians? Because they were the first prisoners in the lager -those
        were girls about twenty years of age, those who managed to survive the year
        of torment. Then in the year ’43. They started talking to us, and we asked
        them, the first question, where did the truck go on which our parents went
        off and our other friends.

      end: '01:25:34.187'
      u: My parents weren’t there, but the parents of the others. And they said, ‘The
        trucks? Do you see, girls, buildings there yonder which look so normal. Girls,
        they are the crematories!’ ‘Crematories? What does it mean—crematories?’ ‘Don’t
        you know? There is where all the people went, on the trucks!’ We remained
        standing. We thought she was out of her mind. But from one after another we
        heard the same story. All who climbed into the trucks are in the crematories.
        An hour later they showed us a fire which rose from the chimneys. Those are
        the bodies which burned, they gave us to understand. These old prisoners.
        And that we could see. We saw it burning, burning intensely. We felt the smell
        of skin, living skin. We are in the “zaune,” in the shearing room. They shear
        off our hair. As they do it to me, completely. A clipper went over our heads.
        All the hair from the head. We look at each other. The fright. People are
        beaten. Hair is being shorn. People scream. The language we don’t understand.

      u: The Germans. One couldn’t move without getting a blow. Our hair fell to the
        ground. We looked at each other. One doesn’t recognize faces. I failed to
        recognize my best friend, and I began to laugh, to laugh terribly, a hysterical
        laughter. The Slovakian girl who is shearing my hair looks at me. What am
        I laughing about? I laugh because I can’t believe. I laugh because it appears
        to me that I am not alive, that I am dreaming, that this is a nightmare, that
        this is not true. And that is only the first day. The hair off—under the shower.
        A cold, horrible shower. No soap. That coarse German woman, that prostitute,
        stands and yells, and if one doesn’t wash herself fast enough, a blow with
        a stick. The shower is over. After the shower to dress. We are given trousers.
        Man’s trousers and men’s shirts. Worn, dirty. We are also given men’s underclothes.
        There were girls who were menstruating. They did not pay attention to it.
        Under the cold shower, they were given no things, and so they remained. There
        is no need to describe how they look. Dressed in rags, and tatters, and these
        were clothes of Russian prisoners. We even found buttons on these clothes
        with the hammer and sickle. A kerchief to hide the hair that was absent, and
        we go to the bureau. The Germans register us. Register our identity, the name,
        the family name, occupation and nationality, and so on. From there—

      u: They knew that we were Jews. From the bureau again with blows we were led
        into a block. In the block we met old prisoners, girls. When we come, they
        ask us what is going on in the country. They told us about the lager. They
        wondered that we don’t know anything, but in 1943 the world doesn’t know about
        the lager of Oświęcim. The world doesn’t know that in the year 1942 and 1943
        they were burning in Auschwitz thousands and millions of Jews.Information
        regarding the murder of European Jewry had been known and publicized in the
        West since the Einsatzagruppen massacres in the Soviet Union in the summer
        of 1941. However, the information was under-reported and considered exaggerated
        by many. The Polish government in exile in London had included Auschwitz in
        a list of camps where Nazi atrocities were taking place in July 1942, and
        a Polish resistance message in March 1943 mentioned Auschwitz as one of the
        camps where Jews were being killed. The western Allies obtained definitive
        information about the camp as a result of the April 1944 escape of two prisoners,
        Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler. Knowledge of the mass exterminations at Auschwitz
        prompted a number of successful protests to Admiral Horthy, head of the Hungarian
        government, to halt transports of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944.
        However, the call for the bombing of the camp was rejected by the Allies,
        who would not even consider the possibility. The passionate debate about whether
        or not Auschwitz should have been bombed continues, but apart from the question
        of whether or not it would have succeeded, an attempt to bomb the gas chambers
        or the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz would have made a significant moral
        statement.25 People don’t want to believe. In the barracks it is already five
        o’clock. The first thing is the Appell—the Appell or roll-call. We all go
        outside.

      u: Jewish ones, who cannot be complimented very much, because often they were
        as bad as the Germans. It is a pity, but it is just so. But this is already
        another chapter. This ‘count Appell’ lasted exactly three hours. For three
        hours we were standing and waiting for them to come and count us up. Hungry
        we were, cold we were, frightened we were, because we saw where we were. To
        describe exactly what was going on in the lager, I can’t. I am telling the
        truth. I can’t. There I saw around me corpses. Girls with tortured faces.
        Constantly screaming. I did not believe then that I would ever live among
        people again. I thought that I had fallen into a different world. Completely
        different world. In my disordered thoughts, I reasoned, maybe, there is more
        than one world, a world where one lives normally, but that possibly there
        is also another world, where life is entirely different, and in such a life
        people also do live. I thought so then because I believed that one could not
        stand it, that one could not live through Auschwitz. But I had to live through,
        I must live through to be able to come back and tell to the world what I have
        seen. I have returned, but to tell it is not so easy. Mornings we were going
        to work. I will give you now an account of the work. I will tell you what
        kind of work we did. We got up at four o’clock in the morning. It was dark
        and cold. At night we couldn’t sleep, because we slept eight or ten people
        on one bed that was four meters wide and four meters long. I don’t speak about
        the food, because we were getting a little piece of black bread of about 200
        grams [half a pound] for the whole day. Lice, vermin, as they say in French—were
        crawling over us as if we were prisoners already a long, long, time. By the
        hundreds; one could not stand it or sleep at night, so badly were we itching
        from the lice, the bedbugs, the fleas.

      u: The work in the lager of Auschwitz. In the year 1943 it wasn’t called anymore
        an extermination camp, but a work camp, and the slogan of the Germans was
        “work makes free.” Our slogan was “Work makes free in the crematories two
        and three.” And our slogan was most correct. As I have already said, we got
        up at four o’clock in the morning. And that day it was raining. Right the
        first day we were sent to work. For two hours we were standing for the count-Appell.
        That means until six o’clock. Five abreast and a capo, a German again, a German
        prostitute. They had very low elements to manage the lager, because normal
        people, clean people, would not have been capable of such management. A capo
        led us to the gate, and again there are standing a whole group of German elite.
        That German, the lager commandant, the work Fuehrer, and all the company leaders,
        the German soldiers who were leading us to work and who guarded us. Every
        soldier was leading a dog, to guard us and watch us. Without a word, just
        ‘left’...'left’...We marched through the gate, and the Germans looked at the
        women who had arrived yesterday, beautiful and young, and they laughed at
        the derelicts into which they had been converted in one day.

      u: Oh, you are speaking of your first day at work.
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '01:38:04.808'
      end: '01:41:51.663'
      u: At work, yes. If a guard had a chance to hit somebody, he did so. If he had
        a chance to set the dog on us, he did so as well. One company leader, that
        is, a German soldier, got out of formation and marched among us, leading us
        straight. ‘Left’...just like soldiers so we shouldn’t forget to step first
        with the left foot and all together. Many women didn’t know what it means,
        ‘left’. They were mother of children, and all at once they had become soldiers
        and did not know ‘left’. They paid dearly for it. The punishment was a bad
        beating. Everyone wanted to march inside the formation, because on the sides
        one would be exposed to blows. In front one was responsible for the stop.
        We had to walk very fast. Inside the formation one could escape the blows.
        The mud was deep and heavy. The terrain was as if made to order for a lager.
        It was pouring rain, and one could not drag his legs out of the ground. One
        was unable to walk, especially with those shoes, which were too large. How
        many kilometers we marched I don’t know. About the beatings we were given,
        about the girls and women, well, I don’t have to tell you. People fell, stepped
        one over the other; there was no time to turn around. It was pouring. The
        chimneys were on fire at the same time. A German was yelling. Some of us were
        weeping. They couldn’t walk. The shoes were too large, and they fell. What
        can one do? What should on do? We arrived. I think we walked eight kilometers
        through a big field. We were ordered to take off our shoes. You know what
        for? We should not wear out the shoes. We took off our shoes. We were ordered
        to step into the water. There was a pond, with dirty water. There was a pond,
        and we had to go into the water up to the head and lift weeds out of the water.
        What they needed those for I don’t know. It really wasn’t any work. It was
        ordered simply to torture us.The kind of work Henja describes was indeed often
        used at Auschwitz to torture the prisoners and weaken their will to resist
        by breaking their spirit. In this case, it served as a brutal initiation into
        the what the prisoners could expect in the camp. They had no rights whatsoever,
        and the scope of SS power over them was unlimited.26

        over the head, especially made, made to order, as we say. When we had picked
        a large quantity of weeds from the water, we had to carry it out to one side,

      u: Only girls, women and girls. That was the platoon, and the platoon was called
        Platoon 203. This was one of the very bad platoons, because the division commander
        who led us was a real sadist. For him life consisted in being able to torture
        the girls, in general the women as well. If a woman was too stout, he would
        beat her on the breasts and say to her, ‘You, fat one, you must get a bit
        thinner.’ And to the girls he would say, ‘You young girls, you want to get
        out of here. You’ll croak here in my place.’ And that badly depressed our
        morale. He had a stick ten centemeters thick. Every day he had another club.
        He tried on us “all models.” He would beat us until one would fall. He would
        say, ‘Finis with Paris, Madame. With Paris it is now over. Now you are in
        Auschwitz, and you shall work.’ And he told us, ‘You don’t know what we call
        work. You will learn’.

        place of work. The soup contained various wild weeds, but that didn’t matter;
        we were hungry. We got it in a bowl for six. We ate six from a bowl. I do
        not speak of spoons, because there were no spoons.

        eating in a hurry, again back to work. In the afternoon it was arranged somewhat
        differently. They took us to the building, an abandoned structure, and we
        had to tear it up. They gave us a special too [she uses the French word for

      u: A destroyed building, in which I believe some time ago people lived. They
        were destroying all the houses around the place. Out of the stone of the houses
        they built the lager. We had to stand and work in the place where the stones
        were falling, so that the stones would fall on us. One of the girls who stood
        in front was injured by the stones that fell from the building, and she sustained
        a fracture. We were ordered—she was laid down, she screamed horribly because
        she was badly in pain, and we were told to continue working as before. And
        that is how we worked at the building, in fright and not to forget, under
        the blows and under the laughter of the Germans, until five o’clock in the
        evening. Then we fell into formation, got our shoes; one couldn’t find her
        own shoes, one would put on whatever could be found. And back we went to the
        lager.

        of soup. And under bad weather conditions, because in June the Polish climate
        is very hot. It is cold in the morning, but in the daytime it is hot. There

        Appell”. Many girls fainted during that time while we were waiting for them
        to come and count us. After that they gave us our supper, for we were given
        our food at the “count Appell” at night to carry us over until the evening
        of the next day. Bread, black bread, of 200 grams, a little piece of sausage,
        one little round slice, and from time to time, a little piece of margarine.
        Finally that we could get into our block and stretch out on our bed. I shall
        speak of my group. We were five girls, nineteen years old, three mothers of
        children between thirty-five and forty years.Henja’s horrifying account of
        her first day in Auschwitz demonstrates why the average prisoner who was admitted
        into the camp could not live more than a few months. The exhausting work,
        starvation diet, painfully long Appels and other sadistic acts resulted in
        feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and turned many prisoners into muselmanner,
        the living dead. Nevertheless, there were prisoners like Henja who, despite
        illness, exhaustion, and deprivation, managed to survive through solidarity
        with others, living one moment at a time, and luck.28

      u: 'No, the children either remained in France, if they managed to hide them,
        or the children were brought to the lager and there perished in the gas,[Footnote:
        The custom to use the word gas to designate the gas chambers, or gas-killings
        (German—vergasung) is likely to cause the unaccustomed listener some incidents
        of discomfort. The word gas means in Yiddish and in colloquial German a “street”
        (Gasse), the “outdoors.” Gehen in gas under ordinary circumstances means:
        to go out, to take a walk, to look for incidental business to panhandle. It
        was therefore somewhat difficult to get into the habit of associating the
        words gehen in gas with their new connotation—to die in the gas chambers.
        This was especially difficult because the interviewees pronounced the expression
        with so much fluency and matter-of-factness that it really sounded like they
        would say “he just stepped out”, or “they are out for a walk”.] because children
        were separated from the mother, and they were sent into the gas. [A long pause.]
        We spoke very little. We were very tired, and we were talking about how it
        was possible for such things to happen. One is beaten, one starved, people
        being gassed. We remembered a song that we sang in Drancy, that was a song
        that came from Dachau, which was composed by the first prisoners of Dachau,
        and this song was very well suited to the lager.'

        rattle of the arms, and only crying and weeping, and no song comes from the
        lager.’ That song indeed described the lager. The tune itself was a good description.

      u: These two verses told a lot. ‘Death to the one who tries to escape.’ And
        so it was. Not only death to the one who tries to escape, run away, but death
        to all those who are there. Now I shall start the chapter, the general chapter
        about the lager. By that I mean, about the psychology of the Germans. Why
        and how they have led people to the state in which we found ourselves. First
        of all, they made Jews, old prisoners, responsible for the management of a
        block. They made the Jewish physicians, the doctors, responsible for selecting
        the sick from the hospital—because afterward there was a hospital—and sending
        them into the gas. They made Jews responsible for management of the work.
        They [the Germans] only had to receive their reports and to see to it that
        their orders were complied with. And that is why we saw Jews beating Jews,
        and that is why we hear now that bandits have come out of the lager. That
        is, the Germans have made bandits out of the Jews. They led them into a situation
        in which they had no time to think. There was no such thing among us as thinking.
        We did not think. I don’t say. I personally was fortunate not to have any
        responsibilities. I was just a common prisoner. I was not hated like the prisoners
        who had responsible positions. A Jew would beat a Jew, because Germans were
        strict, and the German would beat the Jew who did not want to beat another
        Jew. Jews worked in the crematories, which means that Jews have been burning
        their own kindred, because the first day when they came to the lager they
        would be assigned to such positions, and the Germans looked on, and ordered
        them to start fires and to burn.The SS employed a system of “prisoner self-administration”
        throughout the camp system. Yet one should be cautious in stereotyping the
        Jews who served as capos and in other responsible positions in Auschwitz.
        Many acted in the way Henja describes. They were cruel and ruthless. Yet there
        were some who sought in various ways to alleviate the plight of the prisoners
        and engage in different forms of clandestine resistance.29

      start: '02:00:23.562'
      end: '02:00:26.234'
      u: Of course, they burned only the bodies.

      start: '02:00:26.234'
      end: '02:03:59.755'
      u: They burned the bodies, yes. They burned the bodies because, before the people
        went through the gas chambers, they told the people that they were going bathing,
        that they were going to take a shower. And these gas chambers, according to
        a report from a friend I have who worked there, looked exactly like a shower
        bath. Little holes for the water to come through, but instead of water would
        come through gas. And in this way the people were destroyed. And from there
        to the crematories, like into a bakery. The system went like this. There was
        room in the furnace for three people, a stout one, a thin one, and a very
        thin one. And those three people were shoved in, and they burned. And so the
        crematories were arranged. They were in Birkenau, six crematories, which have
        been working day and night with interruption.In Birkenau, there were four
        crematoria which had the capacity to burn 4,416 bodies on a daily basis.30
        [Pause]. I shall not continue in order. I shall speak about the things that
        pass now through my thoughts. I was in Krankenburg. That is, the hospital—one
        may call it a “hospital”. I was sick with typhus, spotted typhus, and pneumonia
        in addition. I was for three months in a hospital. You may ask why I was three
        months in a hospital. Well, they did nothing to heal us. I survived the three
        months of the hospital just due to my character. I was not far from death.
        I did not look like a human being anymore. Only my thoughts were still human.
        I was thinking about getting away. My fever was 40-41 degress C. It wasn’t
        possible to stand it. All at once the Germans came in and ordered that the
        whole hospital be sent into the gas, all the sick. They said that otherwise
        we might infect the whole lager; and we were registered, and we were expecting
        that trucks will come to take us to the gas. I thought that I would not let
        them take me into the gas. I had in the lager a girl friend whose name was
        Molly Zinnenbaum [??], from Belgium. She was a messenger.”Molly Zinnenbaum”
        is actually Mala Zimetbaum, an Auschwitz heroine, who at the age of twenty
        arrived in Auschwitz in 1942 on a transport of Jews from Belgium. Mala became
        a courier and an interpreter in the camp due to her fluency in several languages.
        As Henja’s experiences illustrate, Mala, despite the risks, went to great
        lengths to help fellow prisoners. Mala met a Polish prisoner named Adek Galinski,
        and the two fell in love. With the help of the camp underground the pair escaped
        in June 1944. Mala was the first woman to successfully do so. However, they
        were recaptured and returned to the camp. Henja relates what occurred to Mala
        subsequently. Adek also died defiantly. What role Mala played in securing
        Henja’s position as a “nurse” in the camp “hospital” is not stated. This indoor
        job was another factor in Henja’s survival31

        making lists of the people in the hospital who should go to work in the lager.
        She was in contact with the woman lager manager, the German, and she did a
        lot for us, and she saved me from the gas. She said that I was her cousin,
        and that if I am being sent to the gas, she should be, also. And since the
        Germans needed her in their work, I was excluded from the list, and I was
        out of that. There followed two or three more of such moments, and the same
        Molly saved me. The same Molly was shot in Birkenau in the lager where I was
        because she escaped from the lager. She escaped in ’43 or at the end of ’44
        [??]. She was the first Jewish girl who made an attempt to escape. For fifteen
        days she was at liberty. Then unfortunately she was caught. She was brought
        back to the lager, and on the square—it was ordered that all Jewish girls
        should assemble on the square—and that Molly would be shot. We all assembled.
        Molly was standing before our eyes, pale. And the woman lager leader made
        a speech. She said...

      u: A bunker in Auschwitz is a small room where one hardly can sit down; one
        cannot stand up, one cannot move, and one cannot see anybody. She was many
        times taken out of that bunker and interrogated. I cannot tell you exactly
        her story about her stay in the bunker, because we had no more opportunity
        to talk to Molly. She had no more contact with us. We found out the same day
        that she was caught, and soon she was returned to the lager. And it was as
        I told you before. We were assembled together after work in the lager to see
        what can happen to a human being who displeases the Germans. The woman lager
        leader made a speech, and in this speech she told us that the prisoners who
        applied themselves to their work were being well treated by the Germans. But
        those who betray the Germans—there are no words, it means treason [??]. But
        Molly did, and we all knew what was awaiting her. Present were the work service
        of the lager commander, and the whole top authority of the Germans. After
        the speech Molly was to be executed. The work service leaders approached Molly
        and wanted to tie her hands. And all at once one sees that blood is flowing
        from Molly. What has happened? Molly knew what was in store for her. She provided
        herself with a razor blade and the moment when the Germans wanted to hang
        her she cut her arteries on the hands.

      u: Hanged, by German hands. The work service leader approached her. He wanted
        to stop the bleeding, but Molly slapped his face. A commotion spread over
        the lager. For the first time we saw a Jewish prisoner raise his hand against
        a German. The feelings of the German work service leader cannot be described.
        He was red and did not know what to do. Quickly they took the cart, a little
        push cart in which we carted sand, and they threw Molly in it. She was tied
        up and carted to the hospital. It was impossible to stop it.

        to kill her] before she died by her own hand, she was taken in this state
        to the crematory, and there she was shot by the chief of the crematory, Moll.The
        murderously effective SS master sergeant Otto Moll was transferred to Auschwitz
        in the spring of 1944 to supervise the efficient running of the machinery
        to exterminate the tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews being transported there.
        He became head of the gas chambers and crematoria in Birkenau. After the war,

        Germans laughed and still told us that they would come back to take us, to
        evacuate us, because the Russians were approaching. Three days passed and
        we saw no Germans. We remained in the lager by ourselves. All around the different
        lagers were burning, because the Germans set fire to them so that nothing
        should remain to show that a lager had been there. The crematories they blow
        up with dynamite, and the crematories blew up, and what remained were just
        stones. We remained in the hospital, overcome by fright. A few of us there
        were in good health. There I was with my group. All of us that remained, out
        of sixty, was ten, and that was considered a very high percentage. We remained
        because we constantly kept together and kept up contact with each other.

        soldiers who liberated our lager proved to us that there are still human beings
        in this world, not just beasts. That was after two years in the lager, the
        first contact with human beings, with real human beings. They immediately
        set up order in the lager, arranged things, brought doctors to help the sick;
        and by and by, those who could return home, that meant those from Poland,

        and we remained. After three months we were liberat—we were sent to Kattowitz
        and from Kattowitz to Odessa.Katowice was the provincial capital of upper
        Silesia and was located not far from Auschwitz. After the war, it was indeed
        a gathering point for Jewish refugees. From Katowice, it was a long journey

      u: That I already knew in the lager, because by some chance I met a girl friend,
        an acquaintance, who was in the same transport with my parents. She told me
        that my father, my mother, and my brother had arrived with that transport

    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:00:00.'

      u: I even found in the lager a photograph of mine that was brought there by

    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: So. How did you find that?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: This was found in the division which received the people upon their arrival,
        their things; and among the things it happened that one of them recognized
        me and showed me that picture.Henja is speaking about a section of the camp
        known as “Canada” where some 600 female prisoners sorted the belongings stolen
        from those arriving at  the camp. Though all the valuables were supposedly
        the property of the Reich, SS men regularly stole items from “Canada,” thus
        personally profiting from them. This was but a part of the corruption that
        pervaded Auschwitz.35

      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: A prisoner. I understood immediately that these were my parents who had come,
        because nobody in France had my picture, since I belonged to the Resistance.
        Only my parents would have had my picture. And that is how I learned that
        they had arrived and went directly into the gas.

      u: I was one of the first Jewish deportees from France who returned, and upon
        my arrival there was already formed a union of Jewish deportees.

        I have returned.

    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: Yes. I am getting 6,000 francs a month as a secretary. [At the black market
        rate this was about $30.00 a month.] As a secretary I work ordinarily just
        like any other secretary, but my work, or course, isn’t like in any ordinary
        office.
    - who: David Boder

    - who: Henja Frydman

      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: But I work here because it gives me something to do.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: Can you live on 6,000 francs?
    - who: Henja Frydman
      start: '00:00:00.'
      end: '00:00:00.'
      u: No, one cannot live on 6,000 francs, but still one lives on what he has.
        Many people in France do not earn more than I do, and they live. One adapts
        himself to any conditions. It is not hard for me, because anything is good
        for me, because now I have liberty. Of course, it isn’t what I expected, because
        I returned and there was no home; there are no parents. My brothers, whom
        I loved dearly, are no more. So life doesn’t mean much now. I often wonder
        why I got out, and why they remained there. But one should not talk; it doesn’t
        help. Everyone understands what it does to a person’s heart to lose his parents
        in such tragic times, because we know that when a person dies his own death,
        nothing can be done. That is a matter of nature. But when one knows that the
        parents have gone into gas, that is very hard; it is very hard to bear such
        a thought.As Henja notes, liberation for the survivors was bittersweet. They
        regained their liberty but were forever scarred by their painful experiences
        and losses. Like so many others, Henja experienced survivor guilt, questioning
        why she survived while so many others perished.36

        “maturity”[Footnote: “Maturity examination” or Matura is equivalent to an
        examination for admission to the university, or to about the sophomore level
        of American colleges.], because I always like literature; I was interested

        in the English army for five years; for four years he was a prisoner of the
        Germans. They are in Palestine and want me to come over there. I should like
        to go to see them, but to remain there—I do not believe so. I have started
        life here. I do not feel anymore like traveling around and wandering around.
        My ideal has remained the same, to fight against Fascism, together with all
        those who were tortured up to now, the Spanish, the Jews, and many other peoples,
        because we are not the only people who suffered. Oh yes. We have suffered
        more than others; that is true. We have a more difficult task, but what does
        it matter where one fights, as long as it is a same idea?

      u: Little. The working man who works in a factory and is specialized earns from
        eight thousand to ten thousand francs a month. And to live normally, and that
        means not to starve, to have what the body demands, you need at least fifteen
        thousand francs a month per person. And that he doesn’t have.

      u: No, they are great specialists or somebody working in a commercial field,
        an office of a business where the owner earns an awful lot. Then he pays as
        much as he pleases. But the normal price is eight—between six and eight thousand

        Europe, should keep on fighting. They should not forget what has happened

        hospital; and so I can’t tell you because I have nothing to say. I saw only
        one thing, that the people, the individuals with whom I talked, were great
        patriots, and great men as well. This I did see. I observed them when they
        worked with us. I saw them working at night. They were working very hard,
        but they like their life.

      u: Ilya Ehrenburg recently told us in Paris, to understand, with his personal
        irony, that in Russia maybe not everybody has his automobile, and he is making
        in many of the other things that they have, for example, in America, but he
        has a lot of other things. He has ideas; he is deep. And that is true.Ilya
        Ehrenberg (1891-1967) was a renowned Jewish Soviet Russian writer and journalist.
        Ehrenberg’s loyalty to the Stalinist regime remained firm despite its terroristic
        actions. However he was a staunch opponent of Nazism and during the war was
        the Soviet Union’s foremost anti-Geman ideologist. He survived the murderous
        Stalinist purge of Jewish artists during the “Black Years” of 1948-1953, though
        he never forsook his Jewish identity. After Stalin’s death in 1953, Ehrenberg
        became a key spokesman for Soviet intellectuals seeking liberal reforms and
        an outspoken opponent of Soviet anti-Semitism.39

      u: Yes. [A pause.] Well, this concludes Miss Henja Frydman’s fifth spool. The
        records are from Spool 29 to Spool 33, up to nearly twenty-six minutes of
        the last spool. She was very cooperative. She gave me a whole morning and
        part of the afternoon. But apparently she is a bit tired and thinks she has
        said enough. Well, I thank you very much, Miss Frydman, and hope you will
        be happy in the future, and that you will have success with your ideals and
        with your work. This concludes the interview. Illinois Institute of Technology

        wire back. Apparently she is standing away from the microphone.]
  commentary:
    text: "<p>Henja Frydman was born in Pinsk, then part of Poland and now in Belarus,
      in 1924. She was one of six children, and had three brothers and two sisters.
      In 1931, she emigrated to Paris with her family. Like other eastern European
      Jews who emigrated to the French capital during the inter-war period, they were
      seeking better economic opportunities and to escape from anti-Semitism. Henja’s
      father worked in the clothing business, a vocation engaged in by many Jews at
      that time. Prior to the defeat of France by Nazi Germany in June, 1940, Henja
      was a student, especially interested in literature. The German occupation shattered
      her life and that of her family, as it did for so many other French Jews.</p><p>One
      of her brothers was arrested in the summer of 1941, interned in the Drancy detention
      camp and then deported to Auschwitz where he perished of typhus, a common killer.
      Henja herself joined the communist element of the French resistance and worked
      in its propaganda section. She had to live separately from her beloved parents
      and brother due to her clandestine work. The separation pained her deeply.</p><p>In
      1943, Henja was arrested and sent to Drancy where she remained for three months;
      her interview provides information on conditions there. In June 1943, along
      with others from her resistance group, she was deported to Auschwitz. Her parents
      and brother were deported there four months later and perished. Henja recalled
      the tortuous train journey to Auschwitz and the harrowing, indescribable year
      she spent in the camp. Her account of her first day in this hell on earth is
      especially graphic and heart-rending. Henja’s survival in Auschwitz is due to
      her strong mental attitude which was bolstered by her ideological convictions,
      to the solidarity she maintained with her fellow female prisoners, to the friendship
      of the legendary Mala Zimetbaum, and to luck.</p><p>Since Henja was working
      as nurse in the so-called Auschwitz hospital, she was not evacuated in the death
      march of 58,000 Auschwitz prisoners on January 18, 1945, and was liberated by
      the Red Army on January 27, 1945 along with 7,500 other prisoners. She made
      her way back to Paris where she worked in an administrative capacity for a survivors’
      organization. Though she had two sisters and a brother who were living in Palestine
      and a relative in the United States, she planned to remain in France. Boder
      interviewed Henja in a facility for displaced persons in Paris and recorded
      a lengthy, moving and illuminating interview.</p>"

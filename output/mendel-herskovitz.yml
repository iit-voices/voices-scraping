        [Pause.] We returned to the lager around seven in the evening. We slept there.
        Next morning there was radio [announcement] that an evacuation of the whole
        lager is taking place, block-wise. Blocks there were...there were in Buchenwald
        eighty thousand people. Among them were thirty-five nationalities. The next
        morning one began to take... there was a small lager and a large lager. The
        large lager [ordinarily] went to work. In the small lager there were the weaker
        ones who could not go to work. So the first block of the small lager was taken.
        The last block...the seventieth block....I surmised that the small lager will
        be taken first.

        that [from] the small lager one block was taken. And while the small lager
        was taken, I prepared myself. I dressed, took what was necessary for the road,
        and went down. I was located on the second floor. I went downstairs to the
        courtyard, and there I stood and waited for the departure. I already had told
        myself, ‘We are lost. What will happen to everybody will happen to me also.
        I will go.’ So after the small block [the small camp] which was taken on the
        journey, a German came over and called out that I was to go. The forty-seventh
        barrack I which I was. It came out that I had to stand in the first ‘row of
        five.’ [The formation was made up of rows, five to a row.] Because we were
        arranged in rows. So I say [to myself], ‘No, first of all I do not want to
        stand in the first five. I will go down. I joined another one and with him
        I began to edge myself toward the back. In the meantime I lost the other on
        the way. On the stairs which I wanted to take to the second floor...so I looked
        for a way up. There were lined up prisoners who were old timers who were supposed
        to remain, who took care of the block. All people...and they...and they stood
        with clubs and chased down all the people from upstairs who had hidden themselves.

        comic dialogue based on the inability of the interviewer to understand the
        word or rather the specific enunciation of the Yiddish noun ungetuigs. The
        word ungetuigs roughly corresponds to the German verb antuen which under some
        circumstances could be translated to put on, to dress. The English word pull-over
        is a partial analogue. The word ungetuigs stands for all kinds of clothing.]

        get up?’ I didn’t say anything. I pretended that I had...I had died, but yet,
        with one eye I looked at him like this. With one hand I had covered the face
        and with one eye I looked out at him. He gives me another kick, ‘Are you getting
        up or not” If not I pop you.’ I didn’t say nothing again, but I saw he is
        taking out the pistol and points at me. ‘For the last time, I am telling you,’
        says he, ‘if you don’t get up I will pop you.’ In this moment comes over to
        him...come over another SS man and grabs him by the hand...

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Mendel Herskovitz, the son of Łódź shopkeepers, was twelve years old
      when the Germans attacked Poland in 1939. He and a younger sister tried to flee
      their native city but were forced to return when the invaders overtook them.
      In the Łódź ghetto he learned metal-working skills that would save his life.
      Rather than being deported to a death camp, in 1943 he was sent to the ammunition
      plants at Częstochowa and Skarżysko-Kamienna. His description of conditions
      there shows that work was arduous and punishments draconian. At the same time
      it shows that tenuous contacts with Polish workers in the factories ameliorated
      the Jews’ position to some degree. Note the items confiscated from him and his
      fellow workers upon their arrival at Buchenwald. Herskovitz also shows that
      the Jews in Czestochowa retained some power to influence events by bribing German
      officials, as they did to save one of two transports of Jewish children evacuated
      from Skarżysko.</p><p>Not long after dumping Herskovitz in Buchenwald, the Nazis
      tried to move him yet again as the American Third Army approached the camp in
      April 1945. Indeed, the Germans gave Jews priority in these marches that often
      ended in the prisoners’ death. Mendel was immensely proud of eluding the guards
      and finding a place with the minority of prisoners who remained to be liberated.
      If he embellishes his tale of evasion and concealment a bit, we can forgive
      him; the outline of his experiences is perfectly credible, and, by any standard,
      remarkable. His description of the final, ecstatic contact with his liberators
      should touch the most jaded reader.</p><p>The interview took place at the home
      for young Jewish survivors at Chateau de Boucicaut just outside of Paris. There
      Herskovitz was studying to become a furrier. When kidded that there would be
      little call for that trade in Palestine, he expressed no interest in leaving
      France for kibbutz life. He had had enough, he said, of communal living.</p>\n"

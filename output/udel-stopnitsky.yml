      u: That is the same thing. I was also in Birkenau. From then on it was “obscurely
        felt” that the Jews are not being re-settled but they are taken to be murdered.
        But to murder them openly, they still could not decide. But in time they record
        a case when a woman, a woman from Bedzin has managed to escape—in what way
        is not exactly known—but she escaped from that hell, and she reported exactly
        how things occurred there at the time. At that time transports of two thousand,
        three thousand Jews would arrive. Arriving at Auschwitz they were told that
        they proceed traveling to a place of work. They were told to take off all
        their clothes to get ready to go bathing. Each one was given a towel with
        a little piece of soap as is usually done when people go into a bathhouse.
        On the [door] leading to the gas chamber was a sign in German “bathhouse”.
        The people simply marched in and there occurred the gas-killing. Sometimes
        it would last fifteen minutes, five, minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes
        two hours. This depended on the experimentation with various gases which were
        manufactured by the I. G. Farben Industries in Auschwitz. Because there in
        the lager [camp]—the lager occupied 40 kilometers square—and in this lager
        was a gigantic plant of that great world wide concern, the I. G. Farben Industries.

        morning...I want to remark here, since we knew already of the danger, and
        we were prepared for it. And when I saw that the horror was imminent and there
        was no salvation of any kind so we made for ourselves so-called bunkers, hideouts.
        We for instance excavated stories deep in the ground, we constructed various
        kinds of cellars, we constructed [double] walls, so with the first threats
        of danger one could hide because we had...as soon as Russia entered the war,
        we had information that America and England have allied themselves with the
        European powers, so we thought that help is near and we will be able to hold
        out two, three, or even four months live through in the hideouts. But time
        has shown that that was a mistake and we were unable to hide. The 1st of August,
        1943, we were informed that Bedzin is to become Jew-clean. No Jew should be
        found in Bedzin. I at that time still had with me a sister, a brother and
        a wife with a child of fourteen months, and an in-law [one cannot understand
        whether he means father or mother-in-law or brother or sister-in-law]. I had
        constructed a hideout and we were lying there for seven days.

        the mother herself simply choked the child to death. Why? They were hiding

        for a moment plugged up her little mouth [gagged her]. But because the Gestapo
        remained upstairs longer [than expected], and there were below in the cellar
        nineteen grown-up people so she held over her little mouth her hand so long
        that the child suffocated. She simply choked to death her own child with her
        own hands. That was a child of my brother. In the case of my child it was
        different on account of lack of air and of sucking from the mother [apparently
        mother’s breast] poison and gall. Because you can imagine what kind of life
        it was underground, because we knew that with every day we are nearer to death,
        so it got poisoned and the child died. [Here we apparently deal with the general
        belief that under emotional stress the mother’s milk becomes “poisonous” for
        the child.] And because of that...

        it is called shrouds. And we were sitting there and waiting to be transported
        away. In about two hours there arrived the Gestapo, all the civilians [deputies]
        with their dogs. They held clubs in their hands and started driving the crowd
        into formation, four in a row, and we marched away to the railroad station.
        That wasn’t very far, a ten minute walk. When we arrived at the railroad station,
        we had to wait for one hour, and then arrived thirty cattle cars, cars in
        which cattle are being transported, animals. [The cattle cars in Europe are
        not like the American stock cars with provisions for plenty of ventilation;
        they are simply solidly closed freight cars with possibly a small window near
        the ceiling. In most cases these were the old type freight cars on four wheels
        which had the inscription, “Forty men or eight horses.” But normally when
        people such as soldiers or railroad working men were transported in such cars,
        they were provided with plank beds and the doors were kept open for ventilation.]
        There were no facilities to get in into these cars, but in the cars that were
        standing at the railroad platform [the train was apparently longer than the
        small platform of the little town] at the railroad station, in these [cars]
        entered a hundred sixty people into each car.

      u: The count was made, not at the entrance into the car, but at the entrance
        into the station a precise count was made. They included into the count those
        who were killed, those who died enroute, because on the way to the railroad
        station this one was instantly shot, or it appeared to one of the guards that
        a certain person intends to run away so he would draw his Browning pistol
        and shoot him, at that time a human life was of no significance, who of the
        guards wanted shot, and who did not want did not shoot. And so when we embarked
        into the trains, into the cars, we felt that we were extra-ordinarily crowded
        together. The cars were shut, hermetically shut, without any opening for air.
        Soon the atmosphere became extraordinarily suffocating, people started to
        strip themselves naked, we soon noticed how old people, gasping for air, became
        suffocated in the cars. I must remark that we didn’t travel more than three
        hours we made stops at various stations and the train had no clearance to
        proceed ahead one must remember that the whole distance was about thirty kilometers
        between Bedzin and Auschwitz, you understand how it is?

        18th...the 21st of January we left Five Lakes, from the lager and we marched
        seven days without having been given any more food. We marched every day 30
        kilometers in wooden shoes. I want to remark that it was snowing; it snowed
        constantly, without an end [the last two words are not clear], but we marched
        on. The one who had no strength to go on was momentarily shot on the spot.
        He was shot if he for instance would fall, he was given a bullet and thrown
        into...thrown off the road. and we marched on. The 28th of January we arrived
        in the famous lager of Germany, Gross-Rosen. This was a camp laid out as big
        as Auschwitz but they had no gas-chambers there; there were just crematories.
        When we arrived there, the lager contained already thirty-four thousand people.
        We experienced three horrible weeks. We became polluted with vermin. It was
        simply impossible...after each time when we had searched for them, we could
        find them again [he apparently refers to the fact of delousing; people would
        supposedly remove all the vermin from their body and their clothes and in
        a few minutes would find them again on themselves],

        We got out of the lager and we started again to travel in trains. They loaded us into trains and we were traveling as if with no destination [I am not sure of the translation of the last two words]. They loaded us in open gondolas and here the snow and rain poured down from heaven as if without mercy and we were not getting anymore any food at all. And every morning when we, so to speak, got up, when we opened our eyes with daybreak, we had to throw out of the car two, three people because they had died overnight. Whether they had frozen to death or something else has happened. And so we traveled for eleven days, in on one station, out on the other station, until at the fifteenth day, it was the beginning of March, we arrived in the famous lager
                                Flossenburg, that is at the border, of the Austrian-Czech border, a city. The lager was located on a mountain of about 1500 meters high.

        lost...the danger [his speech becomes somewhat incoherent here], they were
        killing us, they were beating us in castastrophic measures [I am not sure
        of the translation from the Hebrew]. Every day we were removing from the block,
        from the barracks, 10, 15 dead people. So they announced that who would carry
        the dead to the crematory to be burned...it was a provisional crematory, a
        makeshift [crematory].

        bars, and there were again laid out the people, and from the fire that burned
        underneath, the people on top were burned. This was already without a chimney,
        without anything. As soon as it would happen that one would die, a dentist
        would come over, he would pull out the teeth—the gold teeth, and he would
        be carted—yes, they would write down the number of the one who died—and he
        was burned. And since I have suffered from hunger—and so this horrible thing
        came to happen, we enlisted a group of forty people, and they brought to us
        the dead to the crematory and we received an additional dinner [ration].

        had died, maybe eight people, maybe fifty people, one doesn’t know exactly,
        died, and we wandered on. We were wandering for seven days around Elbe, the

        I am not sure whether the name is correct, a Polish Jew. There was a complete
        little town with Jews living in every house. At that time there lived twelve
        thousand people, Jews. We arrived there and soon there arrived transports
        with various Jews from all lagers, from Buchenwald, from Dachau. They were
        being evacuated away from the Americans. Since Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten
        land, was in the center of the military operations, so from wherever they
        were grabbed the Jews they could not go any further. And so we were there
        for eleven days.

        Although I had an opportunity to live with my brother and sister in Munich,

        having gone through such misfortunes, it is obvious that it has no sense to
        remain in the goles, and of sheer resignation after these misfortunes, I arrived
        here in Hénonville in order to get by any means, be it legal or illegal, notwithstanding
        any obstacles or deterrents. [I am not sure of the last two words], just to
        reach the land of Israel. Because to end one’s days as a human being, and
        to live how one should, is possible only in the land of Israel. Even to die
        we have seen already that the goles [exile from the Holy Land] may give us
        some twenty good years again [I am not sure of the translation], but afterwards...it
        does not give us any point of assurance against further extermination, massacres.
        It has no sense to remain further in exile because it may lead to [a situation]
        that the million and a half Jews which have survived—beware and beware again—will
        be submitted to the same [fate] as those before. We felt safe in Poland also,
        we also did not see the danger, and we had much to regret that we didn’t work
        for the land of Israel. But now we must apply all strengths, all possible
        means, even illegal means; there even was a case when we were asked whether
        we would go there by way of Cyprus.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>The Upper Silesian city of Bedzin where Udel Stopnitsky was born in
      1915 is just a few miles from the hometown of Abraham Kimmelmann, another Boder
      interviewee. In the 1930s it had nearly 60,000 inhabitants, about half of them
      Jews. Stopnitsky mentions initial German atrocities there in September 1939
      but provides details only for the period after 1941, when Nazi policies caused
      the Jewish population of Bedzin to double. Not only did the Germans ship Jews
      from small communities in the surrounding area to the city; they also put off
      construction of a ghetto there until January 1943, which made it for some time
      a refuge for Jews fleeing harsher persecution elsewhere in Poland. Stopnitsky
      points out that in 1942 the Jews in Bedzin heard about Auschwitz from an escapee
      and apparently believed what they were told. And yet, apart from constructing
      hiding places to avoid deportations to the nearby killing center, Stopnitsky
      recalls more resignation and denial than resistance among his fellow Jews. He
      holds Moshe Merin responsible for lulling the Jews into a false sense of hope
      that deportation meant being sent to work someplace else.</p><p>Stopnitsky remained
      in Bedzin until the Germans began to liquidate the local ghetto on August 1,
      1943. Perhaps the most affecting passages of his interview describe attempts
      by his family and others to evade the deportations by hiding in cleverly concealed
      rooms in their ghetto apartments. Especially for those like Stopnitsky who had
      children, the results were usually tragic. After a few days, hiding became impossible.
      Stopnitsky and his family, together with many of their neighbors, simply gave
      themselves up. Sent to Auschwitz with five members of his family, only he survived.
      One of his most vivid memories of Auschwitz was the cruelty of the Jewish capos
      there. He was then sent to work at the Krupp arms plant at Fünfteichen, the
      same camp that held Kimmelmann (although there is no indication that they knew
      each other there). When it was evacuated in the early part of 1945, Stopnitsky
      was sent via Gross-Rosen to Flossenbürg concentration camp in Germany, and he
      ended up being marched from there to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia, where
      he remembers conditions being still comparatively good. Among his memories of
      the last days of this “model” ghetto was the arming of Jews by Czech guards,
      who until then had worked for the Germans.</p><p>As Stopnitsky saw it, postwar
      Europe could only be viewed as a land of exile, one that “burned,” in the colorful
      Yiddish term that traditionally referred to anti-Jewish violence. Two of his
      brothers gained entry into Palestine by impersonating members of the “Jewish
      Brigade” of Palestinian Jews who had volunteered to fight Hitler in Europe.
      Stopnitsky, however, returned to Bedzin to discover the fate of his remaining
      family. There he experienced the persistence of Polish anti-Semitism at first
      hand. At the time of his interview in September 1946 at Hénonville, France,
      Stopnitsky had just arrived to take charge of an ultraorthodox kibbutz financed
      by American Jewish charities. There 120 Jews like himself learned carpentry,
      tailoring, and agricultural skills in preparation for new lives in Palestine.</p>\n"

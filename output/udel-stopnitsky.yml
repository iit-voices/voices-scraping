        happened to other Jews. They right away burned the synagogues and the prayer
        house, and a number of Jews were right away shot, they burned down various
        streets with Jews [possibly meaning where the Jews lived], but nothing so
        far happened to our family.

      start: '00:03:49.063'
      end: '00:03:55.165'
      u: So right away, the first day when they marched in, they took one hundred
        and seventy Jews and shot them.

        in poses like it would be Saturday night, they were sitting in their silk
        coats, with their heads [here one word not clear] leaning against the wall
        and in such a pose they were shot.

        said this last three words in English; as in so many cases the interviewer
        could not help becoming perplexed by the story which accounts for not having
        heard about the four graves when he mentioned them first, and also accounts
        for forgetting himself as to the language he was to use. —D.P.B.]

        thousand Jews in all the orders of the Gestapo, that means the German Secret
        Police, had to be executed by the Jewish Community Council. No matter how
        horrible [an order] they had to execute it. [A pause] Also you told me that
        at that time..."

      u: There were thirty-two thousand Jews in Bedzin, because Bedzin is one of the
        oldest cities in Poland, but in time, beginning with 1940 the Germans got
        busy with the little bit of Jews, daily they record various actions, sometimes
        they were picked for lumber gangs with the help of the German police, sometimes
        they were just common order to deliver two thousand Jews. At that time it
        wasn’t yet known for what purpose the Jews were sent away. It was said that
        the Jews are being re-settled to other districts where they could continue
        to live. But in time obscure information came through that there was created
        such a thing as Auschwitz. Auschwitz is located 32 kilometers from Bedzin.

      start: '00:06:17.014'
      end: '00:07:29.856'
      u: That is the same thing. I was also in Birkenau. From then on it was “obscurely
        felt” that the Jews are not being re-settled but they are taken to be murdered.
        But to murder them openly, they still could not decide. But in time they record
        a case when a woman, a woman from Bedzin has managed to escape—in what way
        is not exactly known—but she escaped from that hell, and she reported exactly
        how things occurred there at the time. At that time transports of two thousand,
        three thousand Jews would arrive. Arriving at Auschwitz they were told that
        they proceed traveling to a place of work. They were told to take off all
        their clothes to get ready to go bathing. Each one was given a towel with
        a little piece of soap as is usually done when people go into a bathhouse.
        On the [door] leading to the gas chamber was a sign in German “bathhouse”.
        The people simply marched in and there occurred the gas-killing. Sometimes
        it would last fifteen minutes, five, minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes
        two hours. This depended on the experimentation with various gases which were
        manufactured by the I. G. Farben Industries in Auschwitz. Because there in
        the lager [camp]—the lager occupied 40 kilometers square—and in this lager
        was a gigantic plant of that great world wide concern, the I. G. Farben Industries.

        else, and so he had to work eight, ten or even twelve hours a day. This was
        not yet considered too terrible because after all the people were still alive.

        write letters to them. In 1942 my father died of a natural death, and the

        called: one, two, three. To one were assigned such people who were working,
        they had such papers from the special authorities, and that meant that they
        may live. But to three were assigned older people, children or such people
        who he disliked in general, and these were set apart and from them were formed
        the transports, two, three thousand Jews, and they were sent away to Auschwitz.

        [of sufficient importance], then these people were ordered aside for the time

        nine thousand, five thousand people, which worked for the German Wehrmacht.
        Such people still had the right to remain at home. That happened in 1942.
        From then on, from the 12th, 8th, they began to drag away various Jews. There

        from the beginning, but later he was the executor of all the orders of the
        Gestapo. He knew that the Jews were going to Auschwitz, and he would assemble
        these Jews. He would send the old people to Auschwitz because he judged that
        an old person is already useless, he won’t bring anybody [or possibly anything]
        into this world while young people can produce [or possibly reproduce]. But
        in time it revealed itself that he was simply a traitor to the Jewish people,
        to the Jews. If he wouldn’t have confused our minds, if he wouldn’t have talked
        into us that there is a chance for salvation, we possibly would have organized
        for resistance. But he lulled us into such a sleep, that we did not organize
        any resistance and we went like sheep to the slaughter. Without any resistance
        and whatsoever. And so things went on until April, 1943. In April, 1943, this
        same Monek Merin with his whole crew, for reasons which we could not ascertain,
        the Gestapo took this same Monek Merin with all the other [Jewish] authorities
        and sent them, too, to Auschwitz.

        of danger one could hide because we had...as soon as Russia entered the war,
        we had information that America and England have allied themselves with the
        European powers, so we thought that help is near and we will be able to hold
        out two, three, or even four months live through in the hideouts. But time
        has shown that that was a mistake and we were unable to hide. The 1st of August,
        1943, we were informed that Bedzin is to become Jew-clean. No Jew should be
        found in Bedzin. I at that time still had with me a sister, a brother and
        a wife with a child of fourteen months, and an in-law [one cannot understand
        whether he means father or mother-in-law or brother or sister-in-law]. I had
        constructed a hideout and we were lying there for seven days.

        searchlights—as soon as they would hear a shot—they would turn their light
        at that point and would begin to shoot at that point. In this way many people
        were killed but every day regularly they would send away a transport two thousand
        Jews to Auschwitz. That was definitely known. In the meantime while I was

        the people presented themselves voluntarily because they recognized that the
        hiding is purposeless [a few words are not clear, there seems to come through
        the windows the yelling of a child; we often had that trouble with people,
        especially children or adults as well surrounding the interview room and trying
        to listen from under the windows, and when they were requested to go away
        would sometimes cause some kind of disturbance] and seeing that there was
        no way of saving oneself people simply surrendered so that death may come
        sooner, because to live in such a manner was worse than death. And so they
        gathered the people up to two thousand in a certain place and then marched
        them away to the railroad station, and from the station they were sent away
        to Auschwitz. The whole trip lasted altogether about an hour and a half. One
        hour...

        for a moment plugged up her little mouth [gagged her]. But because the Gestapo
        remained upstairs longer [than expected], and there were below in the cellar
        nineteen grown-up people so she held over her little mouth her hand so long
        that the child suffocated. She simply choked to death her own child with her
        own hands. That was a child of my brother. In the case of my child it was
        different on account of lack of air and of sucking from the mother [apparently
        mother’s breast] poison and gall. Because you can imagine what kind of life
        it was underground, because we knew that with every day we are nearer to death,
        so it got poisoned and the child died. [Here we apparently deal with the general
        belief that under emotional stress the mother’s milk becomes “poisonous” for
        the child.] And because of that...

      u: And so when the child died we became convinced of the futility of remaining
        longer in the bunker, because the child was our only hope, and since the child
        died there was no purpose for us to live for. That’s how my wife felt and
        we decided to come out momentarily and surrender to the Gestapo. We came out,
        they received us very politely without blows, they did not beat us.

        come out he would raise high his hands, because if he wouldn’t get up his
        hands he was shot. And so we six went, we even asked him whether we should
        take our bundles, so he said, “Yes, because you are young people and you are

        resigned themselves...that did not cast for us any horror, we even laughed

      u: Shrouds, in Hebrew it is called [he gives here the Hebrew word,] otherwise
        it is called shrouds. And we were sitting there and waiting to be transported
        away. In about two hours there arrived the Gestapo, all the civilians [deputies]
        with their dogs. They held clubs in their hands and started driving the crowd
        into formation, four in a row, and we marched away to the railroad station.
        That wasn’t very far, a ten minute walk. When we arrived at the railroad station,
        we had to wait for one hour, and then arrived thirty cattle cars, cars in
        which cattle are being transported, animals. [The cattle cars in Europe are
        not like the American stock cars with provisions for plenty of ventilation;
        they are simply solidly closed freight cars with possibly a small window near
        the ceiling. In most cases these were the old type freight cars on four wheels
        which had the inscription, “Forty men or eight horses.” But normally when
        people such as soldiers or railroad working men were transported in such cars,
        they were provided with plank beds and the doors were kept open for ventilation.]
        There were no facilities to get in into these cars, but in the cars that were
        standing at the railroad platform [the train was apparently longer than the
        small platform of the little town] at the railroad station, in these [cars]
        entered a hundred sixty people into each car.

      u: The count was made, not at the entrance into the car, but at the entrance
        into the station a precise count was made. They included into the count those
        who were killed, those who died enroute, because on the way to the railroad
        station this one was instantly shot, or it appeared to one of the guards that
        a certain person intends to run away so he would draw his Browning pistol
        and shoot him, at that time a human life was of no significance, who of the
        guards wanted shot, and who did not want did not shoot. And so when we embarked
        into the trains, into the cars, we felt that we were extra-ordinarily crowded
        together. The cars were shut, hermetically shut, without any opening for air.
        Soon the atmosphere became extraordinarily suffocating, people started to
        strip themselves naked, we soon noticed how old people, gasping for air, became
        suffocated in the cars. I must remark that we didn’t travel more than three
        hours we made stops at various stations and the train had no clearance to
        proceed ahead one must remember that the whole distance was about thirty kilometers
        between Bedzin and Auschwitz, you understand how it is?

        screaming from suffering [I am not sure whether the translation of the few

        from Bedzin, and he shot him, and then he said, “Here, now you may drink your
        brother’s blood.” This I have seen with my own eyes. But this is quite insignificant

        were vacated, because up to this time there were lagers in Poland that had
        no crematories, work lagers. But with the emergence the idea of the general

        of the lager, to “destination unknown.”

        18th...the 21st of January we left Five Lakes, from the lager and we marched
        seven days without having been given any more food. We marched every day 30
        kilometers in wooden shoes. I want to remark that it was snowing; it snowed
        constantly, without an end [the last two words are not clear], but we marched
        on. The one who had no strength to go on was momentarily shot on the spot.
        He was shot if he for instance would fall, he was given a bullet and thrown
        into...thrown off the road. and we marched on. The 28th of January we arrived
        in the famous lager of Germany, Gross-Rosen. This was a camp laid out as big
        as Auschwitz but they had no gas-chambers there; there were just crematories.
        When we arrived there, the lager contained already thirty-four thousand people.
        We experienced three horrible weeks. We became polluted with vermin. It was
        simply impossible...after each time when we had searched for them, we could
        find them again [he apparently refers to the fact of delousing; people would
        supposedly remove all the vermin from their body and their clothes and in
        a few minutes would find them again on themselves],

        we didn’t sleep anymore in beds. There we were lying stretched out on the
        floor with a little bit of straw under us, and that is how we were lying for
        three weeks. During this time the transport of seven thousand people to which
        we belonged was reduced to four thousand. The three thousand people were either
        shot during the march or have died out in the lager. And in February [he gives
        the Polish name apparently for February and that explains the question below],
        I don’t remember exactly on what day, we had to abandon Gross-Rosen also,

        We got out of the lager and we started again to travel in trains. They loaded us into trains and we were traveling as if with no destination [I am not sure of the translation of the last two words]. They loaded us in open gondolas and here the snow and rain poured down from heaven as if without mercy and we were not getting anymore any food at all. And every morning when we, so to speak, got up, when we opened our eyes with daybreak, we had to throw out of the car two, three people because they had died overnight. Whether they had frozen to death or something else has happened. And so we traveled for eleven days, in on one station, out on the other station, until at the fifteenth day, it was the beginning of March, we arrived in the famous lager
                                Flossenburg, that is at the border, of the Austrian-Czech border, a city. The lager was located on a mountain of about 1500 meters high. It was something terrible in that lager. When we...by the time we entered that lager there remained of us no more than seventeen hundred people.

        from among my acquaintances, but I cannot remember the thousands of Jews [who
        fell.] Exactly is known that we arrived four thousand to Gross-Rosen, and
        seventeen hundred...When we arrived at Gross-Rosen they took us to a special
        sector and they knew exactly [how many]. They took us into a barracks; they
        told us to undress completely naked, that was in March, and they ordered us
        to run. We were running, seventeen hundred people entirely naked [this apparently

        like animals. A human being really can’t imagine it, but I went through all
        this and I know it exactly, that is how it was. We arrived there at the lager
        and we got in into the washroom, and as soon as we came in into the washroom,
        people started dying. Those alive were also sheer skeletons, simply skin and
        bone. If one didn’t want to lay down on the bare cold floor [the last few

        [the next word is not clear; he talks very fast], and so we lay down on the
        dead people. And so we remained there in the washroom until 10 o’clock of
        the next morning. No more than 1140 people came out of the washroom. From
        the 1700, 1140 came out alive, the rest remained dead, all of them. And when

        moved again into various blocks. In these blocks it was worse then in Auschwitz,

        time when the German started to come down, because they have seen already
        the danger that the German is losing the war, so they started avenging themselves
        [I am not sure of this word] without an end. They understood that they have
        lost...the danger [his speech becomes somewhat incoherent here], they were
        killing us, they were beating us in castastrophic measures [I am not sure
        of the translation from the Hebrew]. Every day we were removing from the block,
        from the barracks, 10, 15 dead people. So they announced that who would carry
        the dead to the crematory to be burned...it was a provisional crematory, a
        makeshift [crematory].

        [bodies] and they burned underneath. Above them was again a grate of iron
        bars, and there were again laid out the people, and from the fire that burned
        underneath, the people on top were burned. This was already without a chimney,
        without anything. As soon as it would happen that one would die, a dentist
        would come over, he would pull out the teeth—the gold teeth, and he would
        be carted—yes, they would write down the number of the one who died—and he
        was burned. And since I have suffered from hunger—and so this horrible thing
        came to happen, we enlisted a group of forty people, and they brought to us
        the dead to the crematory and we received an additional dinner [ration].

        not sure of that word 80; it sounds somewhat like that one did not weight
        more than 18 kilos, but that seems to be an error that Stopnitsky could not
        have made.] And so, at that time, after a stay of three weeks, there came
        an order that we should march on. We got good clothing but all of it marked

        already in [he gives first the Polish name of the month] April, in the 4th
        month of 1945. And we were there two weeks and there came an order that we
        have to march again, we have to wander forward, that we could remain here
        no longer. And by now we remained only three hundred people, two hundred and
        some ninety, because within this time of the two weeks, again some people
        had died, maybe eight people, maybe fifty people, one doesn’t know exactly,
        died, and we wandered on. We were wandering for seven days around Elbe, the
        famous German river [he says, “body of water”] in Czechoslovakia, in the Sudeten
        Country. There many people jumped into the water [drowned themselves] because
        it was impossible to bear any longer. I want to remark that at that time I
        was weighting 37 kilos [about 85 pounds].

        and wandered and we came to a certain lager called in German Leitner, or Litomysl
        in Czech, [It may also be Litomerice—he does not pronounce the name very clearly;
        one would have to check it with the German atlas, Grosser Volksatlas, edited
        by Zelhagen and Klastings, Bieleseld and Leipzig, 1940, which contains a list
        of cities bearing German and Czech or Polish or French names which the Germans
        had renamed.] that was not far from the Jewish ghetto, Theresienstadt.

      u: No, to Litomysl. Afterwards as soon as we got in there, the beatings were
        no more. They absolutely did not beat us any more. They took us in, separately,
        we were immediately given to eat, we were sent to the washroom to wash up,
        and afterwards we were led into various blocks. There was nowhere to lay down
        because the place was full of people from various lagers. And we marched on.
        In the middle of the night there arrived an SS man and he commanded that all
        Jews should step forward, all of them. We thought that now we are being sent
        to a crematory and we simply resigned ourselves, this life was over, we could
        not live any more because some people weighed 35 kilograms, others weighed
        still less.

        not believe our eyes, we did not believe that such people still exist. We
        saw there Jews well dressed, little children, elderly Jews. Children, the
        kind of which we had not seen for two years. Children like the which we have
        seen ourselves, how they were burned in the crematories, so now we could not
        believe that these were Jewish children. But we saw that people spoke the
        mother-tongue, they spoke Yiddish, they told us that we have come now to be
        among friends [I am not sure of the translation of the last sentence, he talks
        very emotionally], that there is no more great danger in store for us, that
        no German will dominate us any more. We wept terribly.

      u: And signed by the president of the Jewish Community Council, Benjamin Norenstein
        I am not sure whether the name is correct, a Polish Jew. There was a complete
        little town with Jews living in every house. At that time there lived twelve
        thousand people, Jews. We arrived there and soon there arrived transports
        with various Jews from all lagers, from Buchenwald, from Dachau. They were
        being evacuated away from the Americans. Since Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten
        land, was in the center of the military operations, so from wherever they
        were grabbed the Jews they could not go any further. And so we were there
        for eleven days.

      u: They let us lie down and so we were lying there. Those who could eat were
        eating, but there were about eighty percent who could not take in food any
        more. From not having eaten normally so many months a termendous mortality
        set in, 300-400 Jews a day. From 300 to 400 Jews died every day and there
        just was no way to save them.

      u: Before when fewer died they were burned, but afterwards, the crematories
        could not keep up, so many were buried also—burned, buried—at the end everybody
        was burned, the Jew themselves burned them...

      u: Nothing, there were no more SS in sight at all, they were not seen any more.
        Because the SS was preparing already for the retreat, to run away. And so
        I was lying there [I am not sure of this verb] until the 8th of May. The 8th
        of May there came news that Prague was taken by the Red Army.

        full of food without end or limit. One ate as much as he only wanted. But
        that was something terrible for us, because from the not eating, and from
        now starting to eat more than normal people, people became upset [to the stomach]
        and people got sick, and an extraordinary mortality set in, the mortality
        was extraordinarily great. Soon I myself...since I arrived there in Theresienstadt...if
        one still walks around on his feet one doesn’t feel yet the exhaustion, but

      u: Everybody could do it who had the strength, but there were very few in the
        lager who could even walk. Because, as a result of all the misfortunes that
        they went through, people felt broken up physically, not to speak of [being
        broken up] spiritually. I , for example, was lying [sick] full three months.

        my wife was not alive, that the brother and the sister are not alive, we were...I
        explained it to you already...we were ten children altogether. And so I started
        thinking, I had no way of communicating with them and I decided to go to Poland,
        and in the 9th month of 1945, I departed for Poland. When I arrived in Poland

        land of Israel. We did not want any part any more of the pale [he uses the
        Hebrew word goles which really means “exile,” this refers to the exile of
        the Jews from Palestine about two thousand years ago], we saw that the pale

        members simply meant that the Jews were assembled, put in British uniforms,
        and it was alleged that they have been fighting. [It apparently meant that
        they were dressed as British soldiers who were taken prisoners by the Germans]

        approximately] just dressed up and that is how they got away. [He speaks very
        fast, rather emotionally or possibly because he considers the later events

        Although I had an opportunity to live with my brother and sister in Munich,
        they asked me to do so, but it drives me toward the land of Israel. After
        having gone through such misfortunes, it is obvious that it has no sense to
        remain in the goles, and of sheer resignation after these misfortunes, I arrived
        here in Hénonville in order to get by any means, be it legal or illegal, notwithstanding
        any obstacles or deterrents. [I am not sure of the last two words], just to
        reach the land of Israel. Because to end one’s days as a human being, and
        to live how one should, is possible only in the land of Israel. Even to die
        we have seen already that the goles [exile from the Holy Land] may give us
        some twenty good years again [I am not sure of the translation], but afterwards...it
        does not give us any point of assurance against further extermination, massacres.
        It has no sense to remain further in exile because it may lead to [a situation]
        that the million and a half Jews which have survived—beware and beware again—will
        be submitted to the same [fate] as those before. We felt safe in Poland also,
        we also did not see the danger, and we had much to regret that we didn’t work
        for the land of Israel. But now we must apply all strengths, all possible
        means, even illegal means; there even was a case when we were asked whether
        we would go there by way of Cyprus.

        because much too much have we been made to suffer in exile [goles] that we
        should want to remain in exile. This is the end of my story of my experiences

        to the land of Israel, they would like to go to America, but unfortunately,
        there is no other way out, they have to remain in the lager. Not everybody
        has money in Germany. Those people have money in Germany who have managed
        to remain in Poland, who managed to sell their property which they inherited
        from their parents, from their grandparents, and they sold it out and came
        back to Germany, because in Poland they were not safe with their lives, these
        kind of people live there, but the Jews who were snatched away to Germany
        into the lager [here it means concentration camps] continued to be in the
        lager. [The next sentence is not clear, but the meaning is as follows:] The
        UNRRA installations are not supposed to be a ghetto but they are ghettos more

  commentary:
    text: "<p>The Upper Silesian city of Bedzin where Udel Stopnitsky was born in
      1915 is just a few miles from the hometown of Abraham Kimmelmann, another Boder
      interviewee. In the 1930s it had nearly 60,000 inhabitants, about half of them
      Jews. Stopnitsky mentions initial German atrocities there in September 1939
      but provides details only for the period after 1941, when Nazi policies caused
      the Jewish population of Bedzin to double. Not only did the Germans ship Jews
      from small communities in the surrounding area to the city; they also put off
      construction of a ghetto there until January 1943, which made it for some time
      a refuge for Jews fleeing harsher persecution elsewhere in Poland. Stopnitsky
      points out that in 1942 the Jews in Bedzin heard about Auschwitz from an escapee
      and apparently believed what they were told. And yet, apart from constructing
      hiding places to avoid deportations to the nearby killing center, Stopnitsky
      recalls more resignation and denial than resistance among his fellow Jews. He
      holds Moshe Merin responsible for lulling the Jews into a false sense of hope
      that deportation meant being sent to work someplace else.</p><p>Stopnitsky remained
      in Bedzin until the Germans began to liquidate the local ghetto on August 1,
      1943. Perhaps the most affecting passages of his interview describe attempts
      by his family and others to evade the deportations by hiding in cleverly concealed
      rooms in their ghetto apartments. Especially for those like Stopnitsky who had
      children, the results were usually tragic. After a few days, hiding became impossible.
      Stopnitsky and his family, together with many of their neighbors, simply gave
      themselves up. Sent to Auschwitz with five members of his family, only he survived.
      One of his most vivid memories of Auschwitz was the cruelty of the Jewish capos
      there. He was then sent to work at the Krupp arms plant at Fünfteichen, the
      same camp that held Kimmelmann (although there is no indication that they knew
      each other there). When it was evacuated in the early part of 1945, Stopnitsky
      was sent via Gross-Rosen to Flossenbürg concentration camp in Germany, and he
      ended up being marched from there to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia, where
      he remembers conditions being still comparatively good. Among his memories of
      the last days of this “model” ghetto was the arming of Jews by Czech guards,
      who until then had worked for the Germans.</p><p>As Stopnitsky saw it, postwar
      Europe could only be viewed as a land of exile, one that “burned,” in the colorful
      Yiddish term that traditionally referred to anti-Jewish violence. Two of his
      brothers gained entry into Palestine by impersonating members of the “Jewish
      Brigade” of Palestinian Jews who had volunteered to fight Hitler in Europe.
      Stopnitsky, however, returned to Bedzin to discover the fate of his remaining
      family. There he experienced the persistence of Polish anti-Semitism at first
      hand. At the time of his interview in September 1946 at Hénonville, France,
      Stopnitsky had just arrived to take charge of an ultraorthodox kibbutz financed
      by American Jewish charities. There 120 Jews like himself learned carpentry,
      tailoring, and agricultural skills in preparation for new lives in Palestine.</p>\n"

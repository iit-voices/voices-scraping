      u: I’m born in Vienna but I have always been living in Hamburg, in Germany.Hamburg
        was Germany’s second largest city and its largest port. It had the fourth
        largest Jewish community in the country, a community that was vibrant and
        well-organized. Jews were well integrated into the life of this generally
        tolerant and progressive city.1

      u: Then I had to interrupt it because the persecution of Hitler did no more
        give me any chance to continue the study.Among the many pieces of anti-Jewish
        legislation enacted by the Nazis were measures barring Jews from various professions
        such as law and measures designed to make such occupations inaccessible in
        the first place by restricting Jewish admission to institutions of higher
        learning and preventing them from sitting for state examinations.2

        regarding the murder of his friend by the SS man reflects the mentality of
        the SS and the defenselessness of the prisoners. The SS were conditioned to
        behave with utter ruthlessness and brutality to those who were the supposed
        enemies of the “master race.” These so-called enemies could be killed or exploited
        to serve the greater “racial good.” In the camps, the SS could act with impunity
        towards the prisoners, give vent to their sadistic passion and exercise to
        the utmost their “will to power.” When the SS man spoke to Feuer after he
        had murdered his friend, he was not speaking to a fellow human being but rather
        to an animate object or thing.10"

        miles from Weimar, the home of the noted German poet, Goethe, who supposedly
        rested and meditated under an oak tree, Goethe’s oak. The oak was spared by
        the Nazis and designated the center of the camp, which was the antithesis
        of the humanistic and enlightened spirit of the poet and the democratic hopes
        on which the post World War I Weimar Republic was founded.14

        Red army, thousands of prisoners including many Jews were transferred from
        camps in the East to Buchenwald. Some remained in the main camp, and others
        were sent to one of Buchenwald’s many satellite camps such as Ohrdruf, which
        was visited by General Eisenhower and leading Congressional dignitaries.23

        Buchenwald using human beings. They were undertaken with the cooperation of
        the German armed services and various German firms such as I.G. Farben and
        the Behring works. SS doctors conducted tests with typhus, yellow fever, smallpox,
        cholera, diptheria, chemical warfare agents, phosphorus-rubber substances
        from incendiary bombs, poisoned ammunition, blood too old to be used on “normal
        patients” and other pathogens. Most subjects of these experiments died agonizing
        deaths. The most infamous of the experiments dealt with typhus in which hundreds
        infected with the disease perished. Since the method of the injection was
        later shown to be unscientific, the medical value of these tests was useless.26

        the interview with Mr. Feuer. It is the continuation of Spool...Spool 64,
        it was very informal, especially, to give the interviewer a general picture,
        and Mr. Feuer was very helpful in getting other interviewees. I hope he will
        be there soon but I think I will call up...[blank on the wire] in Gary and

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Otto Feuer was one of the relatively small numbers of Jews who spent
      twelve years—the entire span of the “Thousand Year Reich”—under Nazi rule and
      survived. Feuer was born in Vienna, shortly after the start of World War I.
      His family then moved to Hamburg where he was studying law when the Nazis came
      to power on January 30, 1933. When the Nazis imposed restrictions on Jews in
      higher education, he was forced to give up his studies. He supported himself
      by giving chess lessons, but in October 1938 Feuer and his family, along with
      other Jews of Polish origin (Feuer’s father had been born in Poland), were expelled
      from Germany to Poland. This expulsion was the prelude to the infamous Kristallnacht
      (literally “Crystal night,” also known as the “Night of Broken Glass”) pogrom
      of November 9th and 10th, 1938: Herschel Grynszpan (the son of one of these
      displaced Jewish families, who was at the time living in Paris) sought a means
      to arouse public opinion in the West regarding Nazi crimes against the Jews.
      He entered the German embassy in Paris on November 9th and murdered Ernst vom
      Rath, an embassy official. The Nazis used this murder as a pretext to launch
      the Kristallnacht pogrom.</p><p>In the summer of 1939, Feuer and members of
      his family received permission to reenter Germany in order to emigrate to the
      United States. Although his two brothers were able to do so, Feuer was not as
      fortunate. On September 9th, 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II,
      he was arrested and spent the next six years in captivity, first in prison and
      then in Sachsenhausen concentration camp, followed by incarceration in Dachau
      and finally in Buchenwald from June 1941 until its liberation on April 11, 1945.</p><p>Buchenwald’s
      original inmates were German criminals who wore a green triangle. Political
      prisoners who wore a red triangle soon followed. In the bitter competition between
      the “greens” and the “reds” for control of the prisoner administration of the
      camp, the “reds” emerged victorious. They then had to wage an unrelenting struggle
      against their vicious and often corrupt SS overlords. Feuer endured nightmarish,
      horrific experiences in the camps, some of which he relates. He testifies as
      well to the moral compromises prisoners had to make to stay alive, the obstacles
      to resistance in the camps, the depravity of Buchenwald SS physicians, and the
      exploitation of women in the camp’s brothel.</p><p>One of the most sordid, although
      until recently unexplored, chapters in the history of the camps was the use
      of female concentration camp inmates to provide sexual services to non-Jewish
      male forced laborers who could buy a quarter of an hour with a prostitute from
      the pittance they were given for their work. Some 300-400 women, most from the
      Ravensbrück concentration camp, were forced into prostitution in ten camps,
      including Buchenwald. Most were German women imprisoned for “antisocial” behavior.
      Feuer’s interview provides pertinent details on the operation of the Buchenwald
      brothel. The program was devised by Heinrich Himmler as a way to incentivize
      production for forced laborers and prevent homosexual relations among them.
      Separate brothels were established in the camps for SS guards. The women who
      endured sexual slavery in the camps emerged deeply scarred and traumatized by
      their experiences.</p><p>Despite the obstacles to resistance in Buchenwald,
      the prisoner underground could claim several successes, some of which are described
      by Feuer, such as the establishment of a lice control program to ward off the
      spread of typhus, and saving the lives of some sick prisoners. Just prior to
      the liberation of Buchenwald on April 11, 1945, the armed underground actually
      gained control of the camp. When American forces entered the facility, they
      found some 21,000 prisoners, among them Feuer, and several hundred children
      who had been saved by the prisoner resistance. Elie Wiesel and Moshe Lau, the
      future chief Ashkenazic rabbi of Israel, were among the children.</p><p>Feuer’s
      comments regarding prisoner behavior following the liberation are of significant
      interest, as are those about the assistance provided to the former inmates by
      American troops and his encounters with German civilians. Feuer could not bear
      to remain in Germany after all that he been through. He decided to travel to
      Paris, where he had some distant relations and wait there until he could entry
      to the United States, where his two brothers were residing. Since he had been
      born in Vienna and years earlier had registered for a visa, he was attempting
      to gain entry to this country under the Austrian quota.</p><p>Feuer is an obviously
      intelligent and capable individual. Following the liberation of Buchenwald,
      he was involved in the administration of the camp by its former inmates and
      served as a guide for Americans who came to visit the camp. He then found work
      for a time as a journalist and was interviewed by Boder in the Paris office
      of the American Joint Distribution Committee where he was an executive employee.
      He emerged from six years of anti-Semitic persecution and horrific experiences
      in the camps scarred but with his moral sensibilities intact and able to find
      productive employment and function well in human society. All this, as well
      as his desire to rebuild his life in America, testify to his life affirmation
      and the strength and resilience of the human spirit.</p>"

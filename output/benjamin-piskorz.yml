        are making an experiment now to pick up special episodes rather than to take
        the whole story. He was a participant in the fights of the Warsaw Ghetto,
        and that he has chosen to relate [to] us. We...we started a spool which...eh,
        went wrong, and we are...the first twenty minutes will be repetition which,
        possibly, will influence the fluency or the details of his story."

      u: My name is Piskorz, Benjamin. I was born in Warsaw, and that which I am going
        to tell you I have lived through and seen with [my] own eyes and felt with
        my own body. The first happenings, the ones I want to tell you, because the
        whole story will take a little too long...I will begin right away with the
        transportations, when a few transports of Jews had already been sent away,
        and we began to organize the Young Fighters. We began organizing the Jewish
        Fighter Troops. These Jewish Fighter Troops were called Z.P.B. In Polish these
        initials stand for Jewish Fighter Organization, and which...and which had
        as its aim the fight against the exterminations of the Jews which were going
        on in Poland till...till...till the Judenrein [operation Jew-clean, a locality
        devoid of Jews, a Jew clean-out]. The procurement of weapons from [for?] the
        party [Polish underground?] was very difficult, because [of] money, the financial
        position of the organization, was very weak. It was scarcely enough to buy
        a few pistols for the organization [some words not clear].

        mark: '00:05:08.548'
      u: Oh, yes. The pistols we bought. The comrades who worked in various places
        of the German troops, for instance, by the SS in the veterans homes, in the
        ammunition factory. These comrades bought up from the older military men,
        from the SS, from SS men from the Wehrmacht, from whoever had served in the
        army in the year ’14. These men who were already older people, who remembered
        that war [1914-17] and what Jews had done for them, these people aided us
        very much, say with food, with bringing in food to the Ghetto, and with arms.
        This still wasn’t all. For this we needed finances. The procurement of finances
        was...we procured the finances thus, that we went at night, dressed in black,
        in black rubber boots, black coats, masks on the faces, and with revolvers
        in the hand. We went from door to door to Jews, to rich Jews, about whom we
        knew approximately how much money they had, and we demanded from them money.
        The money we didn’t always get. But when we threatened with death or with
        other things, then we got the money. And we offered...we left, every time
        when we took from anybody a sum of money, we left receipts, such receipts
        so that after the war that particular person should be able to claim from
        the...the fighters, or from other institutions which would be created after
        the war. And so not all Jews agreed to this. But against threats there was
        no way out, and they aided with something. For this money we also bought other...the
        things which we needed for the [fighter] units. But in the meantime the organization
        was created which also went under the name of Z.P.B. which was composed of
        thieves and people of the Warsaw underworld, also of Jews who went around
        to procure money in our name. This money went for them, into their pockets.
        And the money which we procured went for the things needed for our society,
        the Jews of our organization. And so it happened, a few days before Pesach,
        in the year ’43 it happened that they prepared for a Judenrein in the Warsaw
        Ghetto.

      u: An extermination process against the Jews. To remove the Jews from Warsaw.
        The Jews...the Jews were...so the panic in the Ghetto was very great. People
        in the Ghetto went around like poisoned mice, one can say. And they shouldn’t...people
        prepared themselves. People made various hideouts. People brought food, edibles.
        People bought and hid it so that one should be able to have food for at least
        three years, a year, a year and a half. Because according to what was heard
        from the Germans, from Hitler’s speeches, that at five minutes to twelve...should
        the war end at twelve, [then at] five minutes to twelve all the Jews will
        be exterminated in...in Poland, just like in all the occupied countries that
        the Germans had envaded. And so people made preparations, that approximately
        the battle will still take not exactly till twelve, like Hitler said, but
        it can last half a year, and even a year. So people prepared food for a certain
        time. The org-...the organization also prepared itself, and on the day when
        the...the Judenrein happened, well, on that night—it was on...on the first,
        the fourth month in the year ’43—the people have...and so the organization
        prepared the step towards battle. The organization numbered about [a] hundred
        and seventy people, and in the last two days the number came up close to two
        hundred. All were provided in the way of weapons, ammunition, clothes. In
        the middle of the battle...

        Because there had been erected around and around the Ghetto a brick wall which
        had on top three tiers of barbed wire, and [words not clear] one shouldn’t
        be able to climb over. Underneath that fence also stood weapons, machine guns
        and also sentries of Ukrainians, of Polish police and gendarmerie.

        the house in which the [woman] comrade was. The comrade, as she had heroically
        begun [the attack], so she heroically died. Her...her heroism is in this,
        in the fact that the [woman] comrade once was wounded in the hand from a machine
        gun bullet, because the Germans made use of dum-dum bullets. These are bullets
        which tear up the body of the person.

People saw that the battle will not last longer, we won’t be able to carry out the fight any longer. And so it was decided...a proposal was put forth that one should escape from the Ghetto. But how should one escape? It was decided to blow up one wall of the Ghetto, and a few hundred people should pass through and only at the end should the organization...the comrades escape. And this plan was indeed executed. A wall was blown up. This is on Platz Muranow where there was the...the...main square of the small...of the Ghetto, that later on also was destroyed [?] in a certain part, was...was blown up. A few hundred people, women with children and older people, were thrown through, sent through that...through that wall, through that blown up one. A part of these people were killed by the Ukrainians who were standing near the fences, and so on, and were shot. Whoever had luck saved his life, he remained alive. And also, after a certain time—this was already in the fourth month of the battle...[correction] in the fourth week of the battle—the comrades decided that one cannot go on fighting any more, that the rest of the comrades who are here should escape. I had in the hideout...I had a mother with a cousin. And this mother with the cousin I couldn’t leave behind. So I proposed [that] all the comrades should escape and I will remain with the mother, because, all in all [?], the mother looked like a Jewish child [person belonging to the Jewish ‘race’], a dark, Jewish woman. She had a Semitic face. And so it wasn’t possible with the mother to escape to the Aryan side, because it would surely be detected. And one heard even about the people who did escape. They are caught. They look like Jews. They don’t have any documents, so they are killed in the Gestapo. So death...death is either way. So I proposed that I will remain with the mother. How long I can make the food last? There in the cellar, so we shouldn’t be discovered, so I will remain. After this the comrades escaped, about thirty, forty people,
                                through the canals. Through the sewers they escaped to the Aryan side and there to Lublin, the center of the partisans. I remained with the mother. On the seventh of May...from the sixth to the seventh of May the people have...You see, people walked around at night and searched [for food and friends?] I, too, went out at night with my mother, with the people with whom I was hidden there. With distant relatives I was hidden. And the people have...the people asked around, ‘Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my brothers and sisters?’ So as to be able to find out. And later it did come out, right the next morning. It was about six, seven in the morning. It was already dawn. There came the gendarmerie, and also among them was a Jew who asked about a father who had been searching at night. That...and that same young man denounced us. That is, he showed them where we were hidden.

        four, five months."

        with the Russian Kazaks it appears that in riding at a slow pace horses step

        group of workers, he would order them to line up in two rows, and let go with

        month [obviously January], we were evacuated from Auschwitz, because the Russians
        had...had taken Warsaw, and they were expected to come any day to that region.
        So we were evacuated. The journey took fourteen days. We marched on foot in
        the severest frosts, because that region is a mountainous region. We marched
        in the snow without food, without a little warm coffee or water. And people
        ate snow from thirst, and people ate grass that was lying on the...on the
        road. People did various things. Also the horse...the...the horse manure people
        dried in the pocket, and people smoked [it] in a paper.

        no one to give the funds necessary for the journey, to send away the transports.
        And so I talked to the chairman of the Warsaw Council, that he should give
        me a certain amount of money, and I should take these people away. He says,

        meet some member of the family.’ I said, ‘I have no family. If the father

        in the place where the mother was burned, and the cousin and other people.
        I looked on. I want to run away from here, go away to Rumania, and from there

        I went down to the carpentry shop, and I gathered the wood shavings that were

        policeman, a lager policeman, and he said it was not permitted to build a
        fire. I said that I will soon put it out. He did not listen to me, but brought
        up an Englishman. The Englishman turned out to be a very great anti-Semite,

        [adjusted]. He straightens himself out. He does not go two, three times [to
        eat the same meal]. These are single cases, that one does go twice to eat
        [eats in more than one shift so that others get nothing]. You understand?
        Singe, single cases. A man who has not...does not know about that. He does
        not realize that it is somebody else’s food.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Boder experimented in some of the interviews by focusing on special
      episodes rather than trying to tell the subject’s whole story. Benjamin Piskorz’s
      membership in the Jewish Fighting Organization that revolted against the Germans
      in the Warsaw ghetto made it natural to begin there, although it was done at
      the expense of background information. We know only that he was a native of
      Warsaw, had studied German in high school, and that his father had been deported
      in 1941 and never heard from again. Piskorz’s account of the ghetto uprising
      is brief but introduces several interesting elements, including the Germans’
      use of Jewish turncoats to ferret out Jews in hiding in the ghetto ruins during
      the last day of the revolt. It also mentions the inspirational figure of a woman
      who died in the first battle of the uprising, who, whatever the facts about
      her may have been, evidently served the cause of ghetto martyrology. Captured
      and tortured by the Germans, Piskorz carried the marks of his own martyrdom
      plainly on his face. </p><p>Benjamin Piskorz was one of the few Jews sent to
      Treblinka to be selected there for work elsewhere. He was sent to Majdanek and
      then to the Buna works at Monowitz (Auschwitz III). There he was taken under
      the wing of the camp’s orchestra conductor and given the privileged job of cleaning
      the musicians’ block. Piskorz recalls spending two years there, but it could
      not have been more than eighteen months. He was evacuated on foot and by train
      to Dora-Mittelbau, a subcamp of Buchenwald, from which he escaped during a bombing
      raid. During the last chaotic months of Hitler’s Reich Piskorz succeeded in
      disguising himself as a wounded SS man with a medical discharge and ended up
      as overseer on a farm in the Sudetenland. Luckily, the Soviet officer who came
      to shoot him as a captured war criminal was Jewish and allowed himself to be
      convinced of Piskorz’s true identity.</p><p>Benjamin Piskorz faces up to one
      of the neglected aspects of the survivors’ experiences, namely the rage and
      drive for revenge felt by some of them. He admits to committing atrocities against
      German civilians after his liberation, and his description of returning to Auschwitz
      to torment his old tormentors provides rare evidence that the Russians put captured
      SS men to work at the scene of their crimes. After a close call with the law
      in British-occupied Austria, Piskorz married, moved to Italy to prepare for
      emigration to Palestine, and at the time of his interview at Tradate DP camp
      had just become a father.</p>\n"

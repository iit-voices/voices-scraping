      u: "[In English] Spool number 102, Benjamin Piskorz from Warsaw reporting. We
        are making an experiment now to pick up special episodes rather than to take
        the whole story. He was a participant in the fights of the Warsaw Ghetto,
        and that he has chosen to relate [to] us. We...we started a spool which...eh,
        went wrong, and we are...the first twenty minutes will be repetition which,
        possibly, will influence the fluency or the details of his story."

      u: "[In Yiddish] And so, Mr. Piskorz, you saw what happened with the spool.
        Please start. Tell us your name, and tell us please the story of the entire
        uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, the way you personally have experienced it."

      u: My name is Piskorz, Benjamin. I was born in Warsaw, and that which I am going
        to tell you I have lived through and seen with [my] own eyes and felt with
        my own body. The first happenings, the ones I want to tell you, because the
        whole story will take a little too long...I will begin right away with the
        transportations, when a few transports of Jews had already been sent away,
        and we began to organize the Young Fighters. We began organizing the Jewish
        Fighter Troops. These Jewish Fighter Troops were called Z.P.B. In Polish these
        initials stand for Jewish Fighter Organization, and which...and which had
        as its aim the fight against the exterminations of the Jews which were going
        on in Poland till...till...till the Judenrein [operation Jew-clean, a locality
        devoid of Jews, a Jew clean-out]. The procurement of weapons from [for?] the
        party [Polish underground?] was very difficult, because [of] money, the financial
        position of the organization, was very weak. It was scarcely enough to buy
        a few pistols for the organization [some words not clear].

      u: From whom did one buy them, the pistols [?]?

      u: From whom did one buy them, the pistols?
    - who: Benjamin Piskorz
      start: '00:02:18.249'
      end: '00:02:18.249'
      u: Oh, yes. The pistols we bought. The comrades who worked in various places
        of the German troops, for instance, by the SS in the veterans homes, in the
        ammunition factory. These comrades bought up from the older military men,
        from the SS, from SS men from the Wehrmacht, from whoever had served in the
        army in the year ’14. These men who were already older people, who remembered
        that war [1914-17] and what Jews had done for them, these people aided us
        very much, say with food, with bringing in food to the Ghetto, and with arms.
        This still wasn’t all. For this we needed finances. The procurement of finances
        was...we procured the finances thus, that we went at night, dressed in black,
        in black rubber boots, black coats, masks on the faces, and with revolvers
        in the hand. We went from door to door to Jews, to rich Jews, about whom we
        knew approximately how much money they had, and we demanded from them money.
        The money we didn’t always get. But when we threatened with death or with
        other things, then we got the money. And we offered...we left, every time
        when we took from anybody a sum of money, we left receipts, such receipts
        so that after the war that particular person should be able to claim from
        the...the fighters, or from other institutions which would be created after
        the war. And so not all Jews agreed to this. But against threats there was
        no way out, and they aided with something. For this money we also bought other...the
        things which we needed for the [fighter] units. But in the meantime the organization
        was created which also went under the name of Z.P.B. which was composed of
        thieves and people of the Warsaw underworld, also of Jews who went around
        to procure money in our name. This money went for them, into their pockets.
        And the money which we procured went for the things needed for our society,
        the Jews of our organization. And so it happened, a few days before Pesach,
        in the year ’43 it happened that they prepared for a Judenrein in the Warsaw
        Ghetto.

      u: Extermination process?
    - who: Benjamin Piskorz
      start: '00:05:14.094'
      end: '00:05:14.094'
      u: An extermination process against the Jews. To remove the Jews from Warsaw.
        The Jews...the Jews were...so the panic in the Ghetto was very great. People
        in the Ghetto went around like poisoned mice, one can say. And they shouldn’t...people
        prepared themselves. People made various hideouts. People brought food, edibles.
        People bought and hid it so that one should be able to have food for at least
        three years, a year, a year and a half. Because according to what was heard
        from the Germans, from Hitler’s speeches, that at five minutes to twelve...should
        the war end at twelve, [then at] five minutes to twelve all the Jews will
        be exterminated in...in Poland, just like in all the occupied countries that
        the Germans had envaded. And so people made preparations, that approximately
        the battle will still take not exactly till twelve, like Hitler said, but
        it can last half a year, and even a year. So people prepared food for a certain
        time. The org-...the organization also prepared itself, and on the day when
        the...the Judenrein happened, well, on that night—it was on...on the first,
        the fourth month in the year ’43—the people have...and so the organization
        prepared the step towards battle. The organization numbered about [a] hundred
        and seventy people, and in the last two days the number came up close to two
        hundred. All were provided in the way of weapons, ammunition, clothes. In
        the middle of the battle...

      start: '00:06:55.418'
      end: '00:06:55.418'
      u: Well, the SS clothing, because even inside the Ghetto, deep inside the Ghetto,
        there was a shop, a factory of German clothing. The factory was named Brauer.
        In the factory...the factory...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:08.757'
      end: '00:07:08.757'
      u: Wasn’t it dangerous to walk around in an SS uniform? Couldn’t another Jew
        take one for a real SS man.
    - who: Benjamin Piskorz
      start: '00:07:15.437'
      end: '00:07:15.437'
      u: And so it was. It was dangerous, but at night when nobody saw, we sneaked
        out. And that clothing...we hid them...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:23.258'
      end: '00:07:23.258'
      u: I mean one Jew shouldn’t take the other one for an SS, and he should not...
    - who: Benjamin Piskorz
      start: '00:07:29.496'
      end: '00:07:29.496'
      u: No, no. That wasn’t so, because the people, when it was the...when the battle
        occurred, only Jews were disguised, and those who did know that this is an
        SS man walking around among Jews, so he is a Jew.
    - who: David Boder

      start: '00:07:43.060'
      end: '00:07:43.060'
      u: Because an SS man didn’t dare to walk around among Jews, because he knew
        what awaited him.

      start: '00:07:48.205'
      end: '00:07:48.205'
      u: Yes. And...and on that night, when it happened, the...when it was supposed
        to...when it happened, the Judenrein...it happened on Monday morning, the
        day which is on the first Seder night. It happened...at night our comrades
        have...the comrades of the organization have stood around and around the wall.
        Because there had been erected around and around the Ghetto a brick wall which
        had on top three tiers of barbed wire, and [words not clear] one shouldn’t
        be able to climb over. Underneath that fence also stood weapons, machine guns
        and also sentries of Ukrainians, of Polish police and gendarmerie.

      end: '00:08:34.982'
      u: At that night...and so when the Judenrein was about to take place, the guard
        had been doubled. It means it became tripled, not just doubled, but tripled.
        It was reinforced. And when the...our organiz-...the comrades from the organization
        noticed that the guard was reinforced, we prepared ourselves. And we knew
        that something is happening in the ghetto.

      start: '00:08:57.880'
      end: '00:08:57.880'
      u: The Jews...and so the comrades immediately notified, from house to house,
        notified all Jews who were living [there] that they should hide themselves
        because tomorrow a Judenrein takes place.

      u: The Jews hid themselves, but not all hid themselves. Only young people hid
        themselves. The older people could not be taken down to the cellar, because
        for that it was already too late. The people have...they went down to the
        cellars, and one had...

      start: '00:09:31.557'
      end: '00:09:31.557'
      u: To the cellars, yes. And people have...people hid themselves. People went
        into hiding. And it was indeed true. Right on the next morning, at six o’clock
        at dawn, immediately arriv-...entered German troops, SS with tanks, arti-...artillery,
        cannons, machine guns. And the first attack that the Jews started...There
        was a Jewish...a [woman] comrade of our organization who immediately...She
        lived near the entrance gate to the Ghetto. Near the...near the wall was a
        gate through which one could enter the Ghetto and she...she had a box with
        grenades. She had the gendarmerie and the German troops. They were pelted.
        When the Germans noticed that they were being attacked by the Jews, they surrounded
        the house in which the [woman] comrade was. The comrade, as she had heroically
        begun [the attack], so she heroically died. Her...her heroism is in this,
        in the fact that the [woman] comrade once was wounded in the hand from a machine
        gun bullet, because the Germans made use of dum-dum bullets. These are bullets
        which tear up the body of the person.

        was hit by such a bullet in the hand. She became, here in the arm, torn up
        so that she couldn’t move her arm any more. When she saw that these are her
        last moments, she decided...she took a revolver and she shot herself."

        Herself. She took her own life. And indeed later, the same thing...it happened that the comrades, who were supposed to go on a patrol to see where the...the Germans were, what they were doing, and when they were doing...one did...not everyone had the desire to go, because they knew they are going for certain death, but when the name of this [woman] comrade was mentioned he went. And...and the...the time passed. The Ghetto was bombarded with incendiary bombs, with the gas bombs, with tear gas, in order to get the people out of the hideouts. The Ghetto was completely burned. People saw that the battle will not last longer, we won’t be able to carry out the fight any longer. And so it was decided...a proposal was put forth that one should escape from the Ghetto. But how should one escape? It was decided to blow up one wall of the Ghetto, and a few hundred people should pass through and only at the end should the organization...the comrades escape. And this plan was indeed executed. A wall was blown up. This is on Platz Muranow where there was the...the...main square of the small...of the Ghetto, that later on also was destroyed [?] in a certain part, was...was blown up. A few hundred people, women with children and older people, were thrown through, sent through that...through that wall, through that blown up one. A part of these people were killed by the Ukrainians who were standing near the fences, and so on, and were shot. Whoever had luck saved his life, he remained alive. And also, after a certain time—this was already in the fourth month of the battle...[correction] in the fourth week of the battle—the comrades decided that one cannot go on fighting any more, that the rest of the comrades who are here should escape. I had in the hideout...I had a mother with a cousin. And this mother with the cousin I couldn’t leave behind. So I proposed [that] all the comrades should escape and I will remain with the mother, because, all in all [?], the mother looked like a Jewish child [person belonging to the Jewish ‘race’], a dark, Jewish woman. She had a Semitic face. And so it wasn’t possible with the mother to escape to the Aryan side, because it would surely be detected. And one heard even about the people who did escape. They are caught. They look like Jews. They don’t have any documents, so they are killed in the Gestapo. So death...death is either way. So I proposed that I will remain with the mother. How long I can make the food last? There in the cellar, so we shouldn’t be discovered, so I will remain. After this the comrades escaped, about thirty, forty people,
                                through the canals. Through the sewers they escaped to the Aryan side and there to Lublin, the center of the partisans. I remained with the mother. On the seventh of May...from the sixth to the seventh of May the people have...You see, people walked around at night and searched [for food and friends?] I, too, went out at night with my mother, with the people with whom I was hidden there. With distant relatives I was hidden. And the people have...the people asked around, ‘Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my brothers and sisters?’ So as to be able to find out. And later it did come out, right the next morning. It was about six, seven in the morning. It was already dawn. There came the gendarmerie, and also among them was a Jew who asked about a father who had been searching at night. That...and that same young man denounced us. That is, he showed them where we were hidden.

        come out. And so I want to mention here that all my things had been burned.
        While in the battle I had been dressed [disguised] in SS clothes. During the
        battle...

      u: Because various fights had been going on. And so the fights consisted of,
        for the most part, fights with ambushed patrols. The fight with patrols was
        thus. At night we went out and ambushed from a few paces the real German patrols.
        And when we killed them we took off their weapons and their uniforms, and
        the comrades would put them on. When all my things were burned I didn’t have
        any other means than...

        naked [without my regular clothes], and I was in German clothes and didn’t
        have a change. And at dawn when I was exposed by that Jew—we were pointed
        out where we were hidden—but I was dressed still in German clothes.

        story house we were covered. And the heat...the...the bricks became heated
        from the fire what was burning, so that the...the ceiling of the cellar had
        become very hat. And the...the heat of the cellar went up to forty, fifty,
        to sixty degrees [Centigrade?], because the ‘breath’ that we exhaled also
        thickened the air, and we couldn’t breathe. So that at night we had to get
        out a little to catch fresh air. And indeed, on the night when we went out
        we met a young man who asked about a [his] father, about an entire family.

        My hair was cut off. I took the bandages and tied [them] around my head so

        there for some time, a week, in Warsaw. I looked around. I saw the place where
        the mother was burned. I reminded myself of the old times so that it was driving
        me out of Poland. So I decided to take to the road, to leave. All of a sudden

        They arrived in Warsaw and begged to be sent back to Rumania. They were sent...they
        could not be sent back. It had to take a certain amount of time, because the
        borders had not yet been defined. People could not be sent back. There was
        no one to give the funds necessary for the journey, to send away the transports.
        And so I talked to the chairman of the Warsaw Council, that he should give
        me a certain amount of money, and I should take these people away. He says,
        ‘You must surely be mad. You are only a week’s time in Warsaw. Maybe somebody
        will come. Maybe your father is alive. Perhaps some member...perhaps you will
        meet some member of the family.’ I said, ‘I have no family. If the father
        lives...it drives me...something drives me out of Warsaw. I cannot stay here
        in the place where the mother was burned, and the cousin and other people.
        I looked on. I want to run away from here, go away to Rumania, and from there
        I will perhaps know what to do.’ And so I took the girls and left. I went
        back to Cracow, because in Cracow I had heard [there] is a railroad for Rumania.
        And so, from Cracow I was sent to Lemberg. Before...before coming to Lemberg

      u: When we lived in a lager [for DPs] we had to buy additional food. So the
        major portion that was spent was spent for food. Not for clothes, but for
        food it went in the lager. Here maybe it is [more] stable. A person gets used
        [adjusted]. He straightens himself out. He does not go two, three times [to
        eat the same meal]. These are single cases, that one does go twice to eat
        [eats in more than one shift so that others get nothing]. You understand?
        Singe, single cases. A man who has not...does not know about that. He does
        not realize that it is somebody else’s food.

        le 25 juin 1940, et je suis rentré chez moi à Vichy. Par la suite, j’étais...je
        travaillais, et ensuite j’étais repris par les Allemands au mois d’avril ’43,
        pour aller travailler en Allemagne. Et je me suis évadé une fois de plus de
        Cravant dans l’Yonne. Et à ce moment-là, je suis rentré au Maquis, le Maquis
        d’Auvergne, aux Brugerons à côté d’Olliergues."

      u: "[In French] Alors, un Maquis, le Maquis où j’étais...nous faisions partie
        des Francs-tireurs et partisans français, nous étions en général de jeunes
        hommes commandés par un Commandant, tout un état-major. Nous étions commandés
        exactement comme dans l’armée. Nous avions des armes qui nous étaient parachutées
        par les Anglais, et celles que nous pouvions récupérer sur les Allemands que
        nous prenions prisonniers. Nous étions commandés par un groupement qui se
        trouvait à Clermont-Ferrand, et dont nous défendions, au Maquis où j’étais,
        et nous étions très bien d’ailleurs commandés par des chefs compétents qui
        avaient déjà fait la guerre et qui prenaient leur travail très au sérieux.
        Nous étions, nous étions environ, dans ce Maquis dont je faisais partie, environ
        trois cents et moi je me trouvais au poste de commandement. J’avais l’avantage
        d’être chauffeur du commandant, ce qui me donnait beaucoup d’avantages par
        rapport à mes camarades qui, des trois quarts du temps, couchaient dans des
        bois et n’avaient pas le même confort. Je vais vous parler de la phase finale
        de notre Maquis, c’est-à-dire la prise de Thiers, la capitale de la coutellerie.
        Nous avons été attaqués au poste de commandement le 23 août 1944 par un détachement
        allemand d’SS que nous l’avons su plus tard avait l’ordre de nous exterminer
        coûte que coûte. Nous avons résisté assez bien d’ailleurs, puisque les Allemands
        n’ont pas pu nous prendre. Et le Commandant par représailles a décidé à ce
        jour-là d’attaquer Thiers. Nous sommes partis à 150 environ. Moi, je ne suis
        venu que par la suite et mes camarades sont partis d’abord, à 150 le 24 août
        ou le 23, je ne me rappelle pas exactement, pour attaquer Thiers. Ils étaient
        environ 150 hommes pour prendre les deux ou trois cents Allemands qui se trouvaient
        là-bas. Nous avons attaqué Thiers par le nord et l’est. La bataille était
        très dure. Elle a duré d’ailleurs une journée et demie, et nous avons eu onze
        morts chez nous et une quarantaine chez les Allemands. Et en fin de compte,
        leurs chefs se sont rendus sans conditions...nous en a fait prisonniers, ainsi
        que quelques miliciens qui se trouvaient avec eux. Par la suite nous avons
        pu récupérer dans les Allemands qui se trouvaient là cinq d’entre eux qui
        avaient massacré des camarades de chez nous et nous les avons fusillés, ainsi
        que les sept miliciens qui se trouvaient là."

        nous rejoindre pour libérer le reste du secteur qui se trouvait encore quelques
        Allemands. Ensuite, la guerre était finie pour nous. Nous avons été casernés
        à Clermont-Ferrand, la caserne Desaix et l’armée a jugé que notre rôle était
        fini. Je suis retourné dans mon foyer."

        pas inquiétées et elles étaient sous notre protection. Mais les femmes ne

        donnions des bons. Des bons de réquisition qui par la suite ont été payées.
        Et nous faisions de même pour le tabac, ainsi que pour les automobiles. Dans
        les automobiles, nous prenions autant que possible des automobiles des collaborateurs.
        Moi même j’ai pris celle du Général Ferré [?] qui commandait les gardes mobiles
        à Vichy, puisque c’était un collaborateur notoire. Je lui ai volé sa voiture,

        D’ailleurs, je ne le connaissais pas, moi. C’était l’Officier qui savait ça.
        Nous communiquions avec Londres pour les parachutages et le gros de nos armes
        nous parvenait surtout de ce que nous pouvions récupérer sur les Allemands.
        Parce que le mouvement de l’AS [armée secrète?] c’était beaucoup mieux ravitaillé
        en armes que nous mêmes parce que qu’ils étaient respectés et les Mouvements
        Unis de la Résistance c’était beaucoup mieux approvisionné en armes que nous.
        Nous nous débrouillions par nos propres moyens pour ainsi dire."

      u: "[In French] I left on August 26, 1939. I was stationed at Dunkerque in the
        Maine and was taken prisoner on June 4, 1940.It is not entirely clear to what
        location Charles Jean is referring to when he says he was stationed at “Dunkerque
        in the Maine.” The main point is that on June 4, 1940, Charles Jean became
        one of the 1.5 million young Frenchmen who became prisoners of war as a result
        of France’s cataclysmic defeat at the hands of Germany.1 I escaped from Dunkerque
        on June 25, 1940 and returned to my home in Vichy.Vichy, renowned for its
        mineral waters, is located northeast of Lyon in south central France. It became
        the capital of the collaborationist French government during the German occupation.
        The parliament of the Third Republic met at Vichy on July 9-10, 1940 and voted
        itself out of existence, turning the reins of government over to the authoritarian
        Marshal Pétain who was authorized to draft a constitution establishing his
        regime.2 Then I was...I was working, and then I was captured again by the
        Germans during the month of April ’43, to go work in Germany.The obligatory
        German labor service, introduced in February 1943, was a great spur to young
        Frenchmen to join the resistance. It caused widespread discontent and contributed
        significantly to the loss of prestige by the Vichy regime as it proved itself
        incapable of shielding the French population from the onerous demands of the
        German occupation.3 I escaped once again from Cravant in Yonne.This might
        have been an internment camp.4 That was when I joined the Resistance [Maquis
        in French], the Auvergne Resistance, at Brugerons, near Olliergues.Auvergne
        is a region in south central France. It has a number of mountains and volcanic
        cones, which rise above large pine forests. This rugged terrain facilitated
        the formation and operation of guerilla groups.5"

      u: "[In French] Well, the Resistance, the “underground” in which I worked...we
        were a part of the Francs-tireurs et Partisans Français.The Francs-Tireurs
        et Partisans Francais (full name: Francs-Tireurs et Partisans Francais-Main
        d’Oeuvre Immigres, or FTP-MOI) was the communist wing of the resistance movement
        and contained a number of Jewish combat groups as well recent immigrants to
        France of other nationalities. There are no clear indications as to whether
        or not Charles Jean was Jewish or was native-born or foreign-born.6 We were
        mostly young men under the orders of a Commander, with a whole staff. We were
        commanded exactly as if it were the army. We had arms that were parachuted
        to us by the English, as well as those arms that we were able to take off
        of the Germans that we took prisoner. We were commanded by a group from Clermont-Ferrand,Clermont-Ferrand,
        located in a hilly area of south central France, was the ancient capital of
        the Auvergne region. It is a key railroad hub.7 which we defended, in the
        resistance movement to which I belonged, and we were actually very well commanded
        by competent leaders who had already been in the war and who took their jobs
        very seriously. We were...there were approximately three hundred of us in
        the resistance to which I belonged. Around three hundred and I was working
        at the command post. I was fortunate to be the Commander’s driver, a job which
        gave me a lot of advantages over my comrades who, three-quarters of the time,
        slept in the woods and didn’t have the same comforts I had. I’m going to tell
        you about the final phase of our resistance, when we took Thiers,Thiers is
        a town located in south central France west of Clermont-Ferrand and south
        of Vichy. Despite the battles taking place at the time, the German obsession
        with murdering Jews was unceasing. As late as September 1944, one hundred
        Jews arrived in Auschwitz from Lyon, located due east of Thiers, four days
        before Lyon was liberated by French and Allied forces.8 a city known as the
        main cutlery producer in France. We were attacked at the command post on August
        23, 1944 by a German SS detachment that we later learned had orders to exterminate
        us at any cost. We actually resisted pretty well, since the Germans were unable
        to take us. And their Commander, in retaliation, decided on that particular
        day to attack Thiers. About a hundred and fifty of us went into battle. I
        arrived later, following my hundred and fifty comrades, on the 24th or 23rd
        of August, I don’t remember exactly, to attack Thiers. We had about a hundred
        and fifty men to take on the two or three hundred Germans who were there.
        We attacked Thiers from the north and the east. The battle was very hard.
        It lasted actually a day and a half and we counted eleven dead on our side
        and around forty on the German side. In the end, their leaders surrendered
        unconditionally. We took them prisoner, as well as a few of the militiaThe
        militia, or milice, was a paramilitary group of fanatic French fascists responsible
        for a number of atrocities.9 that were with them. After that, we were able
        to pick out five men among the Germans who were there, five of them who had
        slaughtered some of our own comrades, and we shot them, along with the seven
        militiamen who were with them."

        for our comrades’ wives in a place nearby...we organized in a hotel a sort
        of a shelter to take them in so they wouldn’t be bothered and were under our
        protection. But the women had no active role with us. There were no women
        in our service, only the wives of our comrades who were being sheltered nearby."

        had everything we needed. We went to the farms for supplies. We didn’t have
        money, we used to pay...we had vouchers. Requisition vouchers that were paid
        back later. We did the same for tobacco as well as for automobiles. As for
        automobiles, we tried as often as possible to take cars from collaborators.
        I myself took General Ferré’s [?] car, who was the one who commanded the mobile
        guards in Vichy.The garde mobile was a special police unit which already existed
        under the Third Republic and continued under the Vichy regime. It had anti-riot
        duties among others.13 And since he was a known collaborator, I took his car.
        Or as we say in the Resistance, I “ripped off” his car in Vichy, and I turned
        it in to the Resistance, which was very helpful."

        didn’t know the code. The Officer knew it. We used to communicate with London
        for the parachute drops and most of our arms especially came to us from what
        we could take off of the Germans. Because the AS [armée secrète: secret army?]The
        Secret Army owed its allegiance to General Charles De Gaulle.14 was much better
        equipped with arms than we were ourselves because they were respected and
        the United Movements of the Resistance were much better armed than we were.The
        Mouvements unis de la Résistance (“United Movements of the Resistance”), or
        MUR, contained three non-communist resistance groups and had been formed by
        Jean Moulin, General De Gaulle’s agent in France.15 We managed on our own,
        through our own means, you could say."

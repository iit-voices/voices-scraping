        During the time of the Ghetto everybody had to work. They caught young boys
        and also girls. We had to work hard. For instance, in a bakery that was there,
        we had to carry eighty-five-kilo sacks to the second floor [in Europe the
        third.] Boys came home with lung infections, with shooting pains, with different
        [word not clear].

        there were Jewish doctors. They were, of course, their people. One didn’t
        know what to do. They [the Germans] didn’t give any medicaments. They didn’t

        a light illness. Then he developed pleurisy. He did not receive any care.

        of course, you know what happened there. And like this it was. And so the
        Ghetto lived thus for four weeks. And then began the deportations. It was

        occurred. We were there on the road on which we marched from the lager to
        the Trage Halle. There were nearby the SS barracks. And there were at the
        same time also...prisoners working there. There were nearby factories, leather,
        shoe-repair shops, tailoring shops, various kinds. And so there had been killed
        at that time eighty SS men and approximately a hundred prisoners also.

        the train did not have the right of way. On every station [siding] it had
        to wait for days and nights. And here we see the Germans are promenading.
        We are stationed under a bridge. On top the Germans are promenading with loaves
        of bread under their arms. We beg for food. ‘Hunger...hunger...’ And they

        any moment they might die. In fives...we supported each other in fives, and
        we were led into a bath hall. To add to our troubles we were led into a hot
        shower, and on the frozen feet hot water. They became swollen, blue. Here
        we could not stand on our feet. We all had feet like this, and blue. And we

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Short interviews with orphan charges at the Bellevue home for displaced
      Jewish orphans funded by French and American Jewish charities (run by Lena Kuechler,
      another Boder interviewee) grant us something like a child’s eye view of the
      Holocaust.</p><p>Nathan Schacht was no more than twelve when he ran away from
      a deportation in his home town of L’viv and went to work for a peasant. In 1943
      he joined a Russian partisan unit operating nearby and worked as a scout. When
      his unit was trapped between the advancing Red Army and the Germans in summer
      1944, Nathan was severely wounded by an exploding mine. Two years later he still
      carried the scars, and part of one ear was missing. Lena Kuechler found him
      in a children’s home in Kraków and took him to Zakopane, and thence to France.</p>\n"

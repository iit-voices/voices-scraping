        in French. All right. I will ask you the questions in English and you can
        answer them. [aside] All right. I am here at the home of Admiral Kahn, in
        the presence of three generations. There’s the grandfather, the father of
        Mrs. Kahn, who spoke to us before, and the Admiral, his wife and here now
        with me on the sofa is his young son. Now tell me, what’s your name?"

        1942, nous avons entendu un message à la radio de Londres, message qui avait
        été convenu avec mon père à son départ: le canari est bien arrivé et il attend
        ses petits. C’était le signal que nous attendions pour partir pour aller le
        rejoindre. En octobre 1943, nous avons pris le train pour Perpignan, et c’est
        de là que nous passions faire toutes nos recherches et prévoir tous les embarras
        que nous aurions en traversant la frontière. Et de la fin d’octobre 1943 nous
        avons pris le train, sans les papiers qu’il fallait pour traverser la zone
        interdite, longeant la frontière espagnole. Et...mon frère et moi avons cherché
        le passage dans différents petits villages qui se trouvaient sur des sommets."

      u: "[In French] Et ma mère attendait à Perpignan les résultats de notre enquête...Pour
        les enfants, il ne fallait pas de papiers spéciaux pour entrer dans la zone
        interdite. Et nous avions tous les deux moins de dix-sept ans à ce moment-là
        et nous pouvions passer assez facilement à travers les haies de police allemande
        qui contrôlaient les papiers des autres personnes. Voyant que tout était impossible
        devant le refus de tout le monde de nous aider, mêmes des guides qui avaient
        été questionnés, sans idées totalement de voir seulement ce que nous pourrions
        faire, nous sommes retournés à Perpignan décidés à partir seuls, sans guide,
        avec l’aide de personne. Mon frère acheta une boussole et une carte d’état-major
        de la région, et vers midi, nous sommes partis de Perpignan, pour une petite
        ville qui s’appelle Osséja, située à combien d’altitude? située à 1200 mètres
        d’altitude. Nous n’avions évidemment réussi à avoir aucun papier permettant
        le passage de la zone interdite, et cependant, dans le village d’Osséja, nous
        étions déjà dans la zone interdite. Par conséquent, à tout contrôle, les Allemands
        auraient pu découvrir que nous n’avions pas de papiers et nous empêcher d’aller
        plus loin. Ceci ne s’est pas passé heureusement, mais à la sortie de la gare
        d’Osséja, nous avons remarqué qu’il y avait deux agents allemands qui demandaient
        les papiers permettant l’entrée en zone interdite. Nous sommes restés quelques
        instants sur la voie, et lorsque nous avons vu les deux agents partir, nous
        avons franchi la gare, et nous sommes sortis. Nous avions laissé deux sacs
        de montagne assez lourds et une valise à la consigne en vue de pouvoir plus
        librement faire nos recherches, nos dernières recherches et explorations du
        pays."

      u: Et puis nous sommes partis d’après...en suivant un trajet qui nous avait
        été vaguement indiqué par quelques personnes dans le petit village même. L’ascension
        commença vers la fin de l’après-midi, et la pluie tombait en faisant des mottes
        de gadoue. Nous étions enfoncés dans la boue, traînants, glissants, nous n’en
        pouvions plus et n’avancions pas. [Question off mic from interpreter] On n’osait
        pas sortir la carte d’état-major de peur de la tremper et de la perdre. De
        temps en temps nous regardions la boussole pour voir si nous étions dans la
        bonne direction, et nous entendions les chiens des policiers allemands. Nous
        ne savions pas s’ils étaient à nos trousses ou aux trousses de quelqu’un d’autre,
        mais on se taisait pour nous faire rater. Mon frère cependant nous exhortait
        et nous poussait comme il pouvait, car nous étions les deux plus fatigués,
        ma mère et moi. Et enfin, c’est lui qui remontait le moral du trio, et qui
        nous a toujours tenus dans la bonne voie avec sa boussole. A la sortie du
        village, nous avons vu une caserne allemande, qui...dans laquelle logeaient
        des douaniers, et nous avions vu un de leurs gros chiens policiers qui servent
        à dépister les gens qui essayent de passer la frontière. Enfin, après avoir
        marché pendant environ 5 heures, nous sommes tombés à pic sur une voie de
        chemin de fer au fond d’une vallée et nous avons aperçu une petite gare très
        semblable à nos gares françaises, et nous nous demandions si nous étions déjà
        en Espagne et non pas toujours en France. Il commençait à faire nuit, et nous
        n’osions pas nous découvrir et aller demander des renseignements, même approcher
        de la gare. En descendant, nous sommes tombés...comment s’appelle? un remblai...sur
        un remblai et nous avons été obligés de passer au dessous d’un tunnel, de
        contourner la voie et nous sommes descendus enfin sur une route qui semblait
        une route d’assez grande importance, malgré qu’il n’y ait pas beaucoup de
        circulation dessus. Enfin nous nous sommes approchés de la gare, et nous avons
        vu une inscription qui semblait bien ne pas être française. C’était [Filbas?],
        équivalent de [biffure?] en espagnol. Et puis peu à peu nous nous approchions
        sans nous en douter de la gare et nous avons entendu des jeunes filles chanter.
        Elles ne chantaient pas en français, mais en espagnol. Aussitôt, nous nous
        sommes approchés. Elles sont montées peut-être un peu effrayées chercher leur
        père. Leur père a tout de suite compris. Beaucoup de gens nous ont aidé, nous
        ont essuyé les pieds, nous ont donné à manger dans cette petite gare. Et le
        lendemain matin - ils nous avaient évidemment donné leurs lits pour passer
        la nuit—le lendemain matin, nous sommes partis de très bonne heure pour gagner
        la province de Barcelone, qui nous avait-on dit était moins dangereuse, et
        de là, on ne pouvait pas nous renvoyer en France. De l’aube même, nous avons
        marché certainement toute la matinée, et une bonne partie de l’après-midi,
        et nous allions prendre un car dans un petit village situé encore dans la
        montagne, lorsque nous avons vu deux carabineros habillés d’uniformes kaki
        et entourés de ceintures jaunes, avec de bas chapeaux [? de cire]. Ils sont
        venus vers nous, nous demander les papiers d’identité, documentation, et nous
        n’avons évidemment rien pu fournir. Ils nous ont fait monter dans un hôtel
        qui avait été réquisitionné entièrement par eux, et là a commencé l’interrogatoire,
        ainsi que la fouille. L’interrogatoire s’est prolongé toute l’après-midi.
        Ils posaient de temps en temps une question, nous ont présenté quelques fiches,
        nous ont confisqués tout ce que nous avions. On ramassait une part ou tout
        des choses qui étaient restées dans nos poches, et que nous avions essayé
        en vain de cacher. Et enfin, le soir, on nous a apporté un dîner très copieux,
        avec...pour la somme modique de 25.000 francs qui avaient été confisqués pendant

      u: Le surlendemain, nous avons été sortis de cette chambre et emmenés à Barcelone
        au quartier général de la police espagnole. Nous sommes restés là pas même
        cinq minutes. Nous avons été ramenés au poste de police, puis de nouveau à
        l’hôtel où nous avions passé les deux nuits précédentes, et enfin, deux carabineros
        nous ont emmenés en prison à Barcelone. Là, bref interrogatoire, et puis nous
        avons été jetés en prison, un peu comme des bêtes, dans de grandes cages dans
        les sous-sols de la préfecture de Barcelone. Le surlendemain, nous sommes
        sortis miraculeusement et avons réussi à faire partie d’un convoi qui devait
        gagner l’Afrique du nord, et nous mener enfin en terre libre. Nous avons atteint
        Casablanca au bout de deux jours et enfin nous avons su sur le bateau qui
        nous menait à Casablanca que mon père était à Alger. Et alors, au bout d’une
        semaine, passé des difficultés de transport entre Casablanca et Alger, nous
        avons rejoint mon père.

      u: "[In French] [conversation with interpreter] In Marseille, it was December,
        1942, when we heard a radio message from London, a message that we had arranged
        with my father at the time of his departure: The canary has arrived safe and
        sound and he’s waiting for his little ones. This was the signal that we were
        waiting for, in order to go and be reunited with him.The German occupation
        of southern France a month earlier had placed the Kahn family in additional
        danger.4 In October 1943, we took the train to Perpignan,Perpignan is located
        not far from the Spanish border and the Mediterranean, some forty miles south
        of Narbonne in the area of France known as Roussillon, the French part of
        Catalonia.5 and from there we did all our research and preparations for all
        the difficulties we would have in crossing the border. And at the end of October,
        1943, we took the train, without the papers required to cross into the “forbidden
        zone” along the Spanish border.The Germans assumed direct control of the German
        border from the Vichy government beginning in April 1943. The authority of
        French police forces in this area was suspended in the special frontier zone
        they established. This is most probably what Jean refers to when he speaks
        about the “forbidden zone.”6 And...my brother and I looked for a way through
        various little villages up in the mountains."

        investigation. Children didn’t need special papers to enter the forbidden
        zone. And we were both under the age of 17 at the time and we could cross
        the German police barriers fairly easily where they were checking other person’s
        papers. When we saw how impossible it was, since everyone refused to help
        us, even the guides who had been questioned were totally without any ideas
        as to what we could do, we returned to Perpignan, having decided to go it
        alone, without a guide, with no one’s help. My brother bought a compass and
        an administrative road map of the area, and around noon, we left Perpignan
        for a small town called Osseja, located at.. what was the altitude? Located
        at 1200 meters above sea level. We had of course not succeeded in obtaining
        any papers giving us permission to be in the forbidden zone, and nevertheless,
        in the village of Osseja, we were already in the forbidden zone. Consequently,
        at any checkpoint, the Germans could have discovered that we were without
        papers and stop us from going any further. This didn’t happen, fortunately,
        but coming out of the train station at Osseja, we saw two German agents who
        were checking papers for entrance into the forbidden zone. We stayed a few
        moments near the train tracks, and when we saw the two agents leave, we crossed
        through the train station and came out. We left behind two rather heavy backpacks
        and a suitcase, at the luggage checkroom, so that we would be less encumbered
        to look around, take a last look and explore the area."

      u: 'And then we left...following a route that was vaguely indicated to us by
        some people in that same little village. We started our climb towards the
        end of the afternoon, and the rain was falling, turning the ground into clumps
        of slush. We were sinking into the mud, dragging our feet, sliding. We were
        exhausted and not making any progress. [Question off mic from interpreter]
        We didn’t dare take out the map, for fear it would become soaked and useless.
        From time to time, we looked at the compass to see if we were going in the
        right direction, and we would hear the German police dogs. We didn’t know
        if they were tracking us or someone else, but we kept quiet so as to be missed
        by them. My brother, nevertheless, drove us on and pushed us as best as he
        could, because both my mother and I were more tired than he. Ultimately, he
        was the one who boosted the morale of the three of us, and who kept us on
        the right path with his compass. Coming out of the village, we saw a German
        barracks...where customs agents were housed, and we saw their big police dogs
        that were used to track people who tried to cross the border. Finally, after
        having walked for about 5 hours, we suddenly came upon train tracks at the
        bottom of a valley and we saw a little train station that looked very similar
        to our French train stations, and we wondered if we were already in Spain
        and not in France anymore. It was beginning to get dark and we didn’t dare
        show ourselves and ask directions, or even approach the train station. Coming
        down from the mountain, we came up to a...what is that called? An embankment.In
        this case, the embankment was a raised structure to support the railroad tracks.7
        An embankment, and we had to cross under a tunnel, to go around the tracks
        and we finally made our way down to a highway that seemed like a major road,
        despite the fact that there wasn’t much traffic. Finally, we approached the
        train station and we saw some writing [an inscription] that didn’t seem to
        be French. It was [Filbas?], the equivalent of [biffure?] in Spanish.Possibly
        bifurcation, which meant railroad junction.8 And then, little by little, we
        cautiously approached the train station and we heard some girls singing. They
        were not singing in French, but in Spanish. They ran off, a bit frightened,
        to find their father. Their father understood right away. Many people helped
        us, wiped our feet, gave us something to eat in this little train station.
        And the next morning—they obviously had given us their beds for the night—the
        next morning, we left very early to go to the province of Barcelona, which
        we were told was less dangerous, and from there, we couldn’t be sent back
        to France.The province of Barcelona is located further south with its major
        city, the great Mediterranean seaport of Barcelona.9 Starting at dawn, we
        had most likely walked all morning and a good part of the afternoon, and we
        were going to take a bus in a little village which was still up in the mountains,
        when we saw two Carabineros [in Spanish: customs officers], dressed in khaki
        uniforms with yellow belts and [rain?] hats. They came towards us, to ask
        for identification, documentation [in Spanish?] and we obviously had none
        to give them. They made us go to a hotel, the whole hotel having been requisitioned
        by them, and that’s where the interrogation began, and where we were frisked.
        The interrogation lasted all afternoon. They would ask a question from time
        to time, show us some papers, confiscated everything we had. They collected
        everything we had in our pockets that we had tried unsuccessfully to hide
        from them. And finally, in the evening, they brought us a very copious dinner...for
        the modest price of 25,000 Francs, which was what they confiscated from us
        during the interrogation. At night, they put us in a room with bars on the
        windows, and before going to bed, they took our shoes.Obviously, so that the
        family would not attempt to escape. However, it does not appear that the Spanish
        authorities treated the Kahn family differently even though they were Jews.
        Indeed, there was no special discriminatory policy against Jewish refugees.10'

        We were taken to the police station, then again to the hotel where we had
        spent the previous two nights and finally, two carabineros took us to prison
        in Barcelona. There, we had another brief interrogation, and then we were
        thrown into jail, a little like animals, in big cages in the basement of the
        Barcelona Prefecture. The next day, miraculously, we got out and managed to
        join a convoy going to North Africa and to finally take us into the free zone.
        We reached Casablanca after two days, and we finally learned on the boat to
        Casablanca that my father was in Algiers.Jean does not explain why the family
        was “miraculously” let out to join the convoy sailing for North Africa and
        to the city of Casablanca, the principal port of Morocco, located on the North
        African Atlantic seaboard. Morocco was then under French control.11 And so,
        by the end of the week, once we got past the difficulties of the journey from
        Casablanca to Algiers, we were reunited with my father.By the time the Kahns
        arrived in North Africa, the Allies had driven the Axis powers and their Vichy
        French allies out of the region including Algeria. The French North African
        colonies were under the rule of the Free French government headed by General
        Charles De Gaulle.12"

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Jean Kahn was only ten years old when France capitulated to Nazi Germany
      in 1940. He was the youngest member of his family to endure the trials and tribulations
      of the Occupation. In his interview, Jean recounts the daring escape he, his
      mother, and elder brother, Pierre, made across the Pyrenees mountains into neutral
      Spain in October 1943. They were among the some 30,000 Jews from France who
      made this difficult journey during the war years. They went without a guide
      and like most other Jewish escapees arranged their trip independently, without
      the aid of a rescue organization.</p><p>The Kahns were fortunate in their timing,
      because after the German occupation of southern France on November 11, 1942
      (following the Allied landings in North Africa several days earlier), the Spanish
      expelled few refugees who managed successful border crossings. By the fall of
      1943, when the Kahns crossed into Spain, it was obvious that the Germans were
      losing the war, and the Allies had put pressure on Spain earlier that year not
      to turn away refugees who had crossed the Spanish border—provided that they
      would leave the country for another destination without delay. One estimate
      is that between the summer of 1942 and the fall of 1944, some 7,500 Jews found
      temporary refuge in Spain.</p><p>This interview is part of a group of interviews
      with the eminent Kahn family and their chauffeur taken in Paris on August 21,
      1946 during an evening at the home of Admiral Louis Kahn. The interviews were
      conducted in the following order: Abraham Schramack (Mrs. Kahn’s father), Jean
      Kahn (the family’s younger son) Anne Marcelle Kahn, and her husband, Admiral
      Kahn. These are followed by an interview with the family’s chauffeur, Charles
      Jean, who during the German occupation was in the French resistance. The Kahns
      were among the approximately 150,000 French Jews who had deep roots in France.
      (Another 200,000 Jews in France during the Holocaust were more recent immigrants.)
      Despite their long-standing residence in France, the Kahn family lived a precarious
      existence during the Occupation. Due to his service in the French navy, Admiral
      Kahn was separated from his family at the start of the war and was not in France
      during the war years.</p>"

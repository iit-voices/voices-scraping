        I went down again to the bridge and asked the captain again, but he said “No,
        no. I haven’t got any instructions as yet. It might last two or three days.”
        And he suggested that I should go to the country to a farm and to remain there,
        but I found a kind of barn in a house which had been bombed out, but part
        of it was still standing. So I found a room there and I was quite, more or

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Sometimes a survivor’s experiences of the camps arouse less interest
      than the events surrounding them. Nelly Bondy spent two years at Auschwitz and
      then in Ravensbrück and its satellite camps, but what happened to her during
      that time was exceptional only in that her knowledge of German and English qualified
      her for a comparatively protected job in the Political Department of the Auschwitz
      administration offices. Of that job she has little to say beyond her matter-of-fact
      report that she learned from the files of the death of her husband, who had
      been sent there long before her arrival.</p><p>Bondy has more to say about her
      frantic efforts between 1940 and 1943 to keep her family together and protect
      her children from the Germans. Born in Vienna around 1915, she had met and married
      her husband, a Czech Jew living in Paris, in the mid-1930s. When Paris came
      under German fire in 1940, she bicycled to the south of France to reunite with
      her husband, then serving in a Czech unit under French command, and her two
      children. Her husband was arrested in 1941, shortly after the birth of their
      third child, and she smuggled all three of the children to safety in the unoccupied
      zone. She was arrested herself in March 1943 and after three months at Drancy
      was sent to Auschwitz.</p><p>Still more interesting is Bondy’s account of her
      escape from a Nazi death march at the end of the war. Evacuated from Auschwitz
      to Ravensbrück and then to a series of work camps south of Berlin, she simply
      walked away from her camp during an air raid and passed as a German refugee.
      Fluent in German, she had the wit to exploit the chaos of the collapsing Reich
      and secure the assistance of Nazi welfare agencies to stay alive in spite of
      her frostbitten feet. We will never know for certain if escaping saved her life,
      but it may have done so. SS men sometimes shot their charges at the last moment
      rather than let them go. In the last days of the war she found herself in a
      German-held area surrounded by Russian and American forces, encountering little
      sympathy from the latter when she approached them for help.</p><p>Boder interviewed
      Bondy in a storage room of one of the Paris offices of the Joint Distribution
      Committee.</p>\n"

        who would...who would...join the enemy would be shot. So I didn’t want to
        be shot after two years of Auschwitz, and I was just thinking it over when
        I saw a group of French prisoners of war who were taking this road. So I called

        of war.” The captain came back and told me, “I’m extremely sorry for you,
        but so far I haven’t got any instructions for political prisoners, just for
        prisoners of war.” I said, “What shall I do? I haven’t any money. I haven’t
        got any papers. I have got nothing to eat. Couldn’t you take me over? I have
        a bad foot and I need a doctor.” “I’m extremely sorry, I can’t. I can’t. Come
        back tomorrow. Perhaps I’ll have such instructions by then.” Next morning

        and they had a kind of barn where they were sleeping. They were five or six,
        and they arranged a corner for me, and I spent the night there. Next morning
        I went down again to the bridge and asked the captain again, but he said “No,
        no. I haven’t got any instructions as yet. It might last two or three days.”
        And he suggested that I should go to the country to a farm and to remain there,
        but I found a kind of barn in a house which had been bombed out, but part
        of it was still standing. So I found a room there and I was quite, more or
        less comfortable up there.

        made an exception for us who were working with them. They behaved fairly well.
        Of course, if they had an occasion they got drunk even if we were there or
        not. That was a different kind of thing; but on a general scale they treated
        us...ah...like machines, like automatons, you see.

        She was born in Augustów, in Poland, forty-four years ago. She lives now in
        Paris. She is the wife of the concierge at the building that originally belongs,
        or possibly now belongs, to the [unintelligible] Hotel that is rented for
        a home of transient displaced people. [Her husband works at present as a janitor.]

      u: Yes. We saw the first ones arriving in Paris. We lived not far from the city
        gates. I saw the first Germans. I was together with a number of women friends.
        Many of them, seeing the Germans (because they have already run away from
        Austria and Germany) fainted on the streets. And the Germans gave orders that
        people shouldn’t run, they should be calm, nothing will be done to them. Yes.
        So we stood on the streets, three, four, five days.

        only a bundle of ten kilos and driven out of their homes, and [that the Germans]
        have taken away their wealth and when they came to Paris and told these things
        people did not believe. We said, A people such as the German people! one cannot
        believe that they will do such things to human beings. Alore, they were with
        us until ’41. [Here apparently is a discrepancy in the years, but for some
        reason I didn’t interrupt her.] At the beginning they were distributing food
        to the population. To the children they would throw chocolate.

        families in one building. A kind of tenement. They took their little bundles
        and voluntarily presented themselves for work. They were told that they will

        in the fields. The smart people did not go. Only the fools went and believed
        that the Germans still have a bit of heart, that they wanted nothing of them.
        My husband did not go. From our house a few neighbors went. Since my husband
        is a Polish citizen he had to go for an extension of his papers to the Prefecture
        every three months. So he was told that he has to present himself “voluntarily”
        for military service.

        has to go. This time one is unable to wiggle himself out because it was said
        that if the man will not present himself they will take the families and the
        children. And so I assembled a bundle for my husband. Various small things,
        underwear, and such things and a lot of neighbors from Pelmont all were sitting
        around and it was said on that night that those who have not presented themselves
        — they will come and take them from the homes by force. Frenchmen. We were
        sitting there. The children slept in a kind of a vestibule — a large room
        like here, in the vestibule. And my husband and I were sitting like here,
        at the window. It was already one; it was already two o’clock. We wanted to
        see what was going to happen. As I sit so with my husband we hear the gates
        opening and there enter about twenty motorcyclists with revolvers, gendarmes,
        police, inspectors, all Frenchmen. We saw no Germans. And they spread out
        over the four corners of the yard, all of them. Five or six men went up into
        each stairway. Soon the gates were shut and they started going from door to
        door. Ouvre la porte! We are doomed. They came in. They came in. So I thought
        that they have come to take my husband. And as if an angel had pushed my hand,
        I say to my husband, “You know what? I shall tell them that you are not here.
        Let them do what they want. They won’t take me and the children. Certainly
        not. I will tell them that you are sick, that you are away in some hospital:,

        with a kind of a door. So I gave him a push into that little kitchen and I
        posted myself in front of the door. So he comes in and says, “Where is your
        husband?” I say, “My husband isn’t here. What do you want?”—“We have come

        This night, the 16th of July, 13th of July, we have an order to arrest women
        with children without exception and to send them to Drancy.” Alors! I immediately
        fainted. But I pulled myself together so that my husband should not come out
        from hiding. And he stood in the corner by the door hidden well. I pulled
        myself together. The children, hearing it, started crying, and they all came
        into the room. “Mama, what are you doing?” And I said, “Yes, my child, the
        time has come. We have to go.” [Here is a long pause and she weeps bitterly.
        Fully three sentences are not understandable due to loud and violent sobbing.]

        up from their sleep and all came in naked to me and into the other room. So
        I said, “Children, we have to dress.” [The next sentence isn’t clear; she
        is still sobbing. The best I can get is, “We have to go, to go to the lager.”]
        Just like this. One of them was nineteen. The second was sixteen years old.
        The boy was twelve years old and the little girl was eight years old. And
        there stood two inspectors and two policemen and they told us, “Take with
        you this, and take with you that, because you probably will have to be in
        the lager for a long time and it will be cold there. Take with you things

        in the best of health because I suffer from gall bladder. I was very sick.
        And the daughter of mine, had very much courage. She dragged the bundles.
        She got a hold of some straw that was lying around on the sides prepared for
        the people and she fixed a “lay-down.” “Here, mother”, she said, “here we
        will lie down and we shall sleep over the night.” It was very hard to find
        some room. People were lying almost one over the other. Jammed together like
        herring and there was room for 100,000 people. That night was the night just

        Some food was cooked and distributed afterwards for midday. The children got
        something thrown — the children got something thrown to them. The Frenchmen
        pretended to be kind. [Mockingly] It was not their fault, the Germans were

        days with the children. During these five days the place was a battlefield.
        They carried away about five hundred dead, people who just died. The aged,
        the sick, the chronically ill, they couldn’t stand it for more than a day
        or two. If they come into a house and lead out a person who has been lying
        sick and they take him away, where are they taking him away? — To die! Just
        driven like sheep with a stave. Five hundred people, men, women, children

        with the people just as if these people had no business to be alive anymore.
        Hurry up, a tap with a stick and that is all. There were a few nurses because
        the people were very excited. Every time when a woman or a child would raise
        their voice crying the whole velodrom, as many as there were, could cry with
        them. The destruction of the temple! I personally could not cry any more.
        I had on my heart a sheet of iron. It wasn’t that I had courage. I simply
        was prostrated. The children would bring a bit of water, a bit of tea, and
        so we remained there all these days. Every day some people were selected and
        went away. By and by, some to Pithiviers, some to Drancy. Those with children
        to Pithiviers. Single persons to Drancy. One who has not gone through the
        velodrom Iviere personally cannot imagine what was going on there. It is impossible
        Monsieur Professor, to present a picture of the events. Impossible. Impossible
        to make a picture of it. One had to have iron strength and a heart of a beast,
        of a horse. Words are of no avail. Meanwhile my husband succeeded to get out
        of the apartment and he hurried to a good friend of his who worked for the
        Germans. A furrier, who made fur coats for the winter, such little fur vests.
        And this one had the right to get out women and children from the velodrom
        whom the French had arrested. And there was a large “microphone” [Footnote:
        She of course refers to an address system.] in the middle of the place on
        the velodrom, and there they called out the names. Those families who were
        arrested whose men worked for the Germans and had certificates, certificates,
        those would be set free immediately. They were ordered to be set free. Here
        I saw they set free a family one day, then the next day a lot of families
        are being set free, and here I am very weak, and I say to my children, “Children,
        go to the microphone. Maybe our name too will be called. Maybe Father has
        done something for us. He has a good friend who works for the Germans; maybe
        he has gone to see him, maybe he has asked him” So they gave our name reversed.'

        do? There came our turn and they take us to Pithiviers. There is no liberator
        for us. They led us out five o’clock in the morning from the velodrom and
        there stood twenty large busses on the square and at the gate there stood
        about fifty gredarmes and policemen and inspectors and they led us just like
        they lead criminals, those who have committed the greatest crimes in the world.
        That is the way they led us. During the five days at the velodrom the place
        was terribly dirty. One didn’t see any water for washing purposes. The toilets
        (if you excuse me) had overrun. There stood around a lot of acquaintances
        who were not arrested, with bundles — all around the gates, to send in food
        for the children. But the Frenchmen fired at them and did not permit a single
        bundle to pass into the velodrom for the people. And as many people that came
        there with bundles for the unfortunate people, those who still remained free
        all had to go back. They were all driven away. Not a crum was permitted to
        pass. The people who were already there do not have to eat. They are doomed.
        Do you understand? That was all. And they have to return. They have spent
        heavy money and everything got spoiled, perished, and they had to throw it
        out and the French did not admit into the velodrom even an ounce of bread,
        and no food, and that was during the fruit season. Children were running around
        with starved lips, blue, and the French wouldn’t pass a single piece of fruit
        for the children. And so we were led away. We were loaded into large busses,
        and the gendarmes, the policemen and inspectors stood at the gate..."

      u: There were transports from the velodrom to Pithiviers. Five days it lasted.
        I was exactly in the last transport. Alors! They led us out through the gate
        and it was five o’clock in the morning. Of course, that was done by the murderers
        so that nobody should see how they proceed with their “fine” business. The
        open world should not see what they were doing. We were led out and we did
        not see a person on the street. There are only fifty people at the gate. Standing
        there. Gendarmes, policement, and inspectors. Frenchmen. They stood there
        and looked at us very indifferently. As if they were thinking, “That is very
        good. Now has come the time when we will get rid of the Jews here, because
        the Jews are our misfortune here, in France. They are taking away our business;
        they eat away from us everything; and we just stand there and look on. Now
        we are the masters. We shall get rid of them.” Cold, with tight lips, they
        stood there like murderers. Just like they would have led us out to the dance,
        to a ball, indifferent. And they laughed, they were amused over us. We are
        being dragged at five o’clock with the bundles, with little children in our
        arms, and so we were taken to a train. We were ordered to get out of the busses.
        On the side stood passengers. Frenchmen, Frenchwomen, who saw us disembark
        from the busses and led into the train. They laughed. Why? we were loaded
        in a train like the kind in which animals are being transported. Cattle, horses
        — the cars were locked, without windows, without air, just like beasts are
        being transported. Cattle. Alors! We all got in. It was very high to climb.
        We finally packed ourselves up, one shoving the other.

      u: Men, women, children, old ones and young ones. All were there. Somehow, a
        “lay-down” was fixed for me. They spread out a bit of straw. Everyone had
        some rags, a blanket, a little towel. I saw even some foolish people who had
        dragged with them feather-beds. They exhausted their guts dragging them. They
        were all exhausted. What for? Just to salvage a few more things from home.
        Let it be a pillow; let it be a feather bed; let it be some of the better
        things. It’s all over. We shan’t see our homes anymore. We shall not see our
        things anymore. They exhausted their guts. My child was made to drag a quota
        of bundles, the sixteen-year-old one. And the poor dear spread out on the
        straw and I asked she should be given something to soothe her. “Nurse, give
        here something.” And she gave her some kind of a pill to put her to sleep.
        Well. She got pains dragging the bundles. I couldn’t carry anything. I was
        very weak. I was taken from bed, sick. I had an attack of gall bladder. But
        she dragged. She was the older one. Sixteen years old. She looked like a twenty-year-old
        one. Everybody calls her the beautiful Marie [she begins to weep] She was
        so beautiful. [Here a few words become incomprehensible due to her sobbing.
        All one hears are the words “my child.” Women would approach me, “Madam, who
        is this young girl, the beautiful one, the blond one?” [Here she sobs violently.]
        My child. [Wails again cover her words. Only words audible, “my daughter.”
        We arrived in Pithiviers. A day passed. And she became a bit stronger, but
        she still was weak and she lost all her courage. So she says, “Mother, I feel
        that from here I shall not get out anymore.” So I say, “Mara, you are young.
        You had courage; so go on having courage. God will not abandon us. Let us
        see what will happen next.” So she says, “you know I have a girl friend, an
        Austrian, Mariann.” Mariann Brger, was her name. A neighbor of ours. And she
        had a canteen, a canteen where they were selling all kinds of things to prisoners.
        Some lemonade, a comb, a handkerchief, some other little things. Notion, and
        such other things, so she engaged her to be a salesgirl. So she said, “I have
        accepted the job, I will be with Mariann,” she said, “I want to do it.” So
        she together with the other used to carry around the lager such big cases
        of dirty bottles, selling one to each, one to each, one to each, one to each,
        one to each. Just as much as she could. She met with an accident. I was out
        in the yard with the two children. She was lying on the straw. She was very
        tired and since there were little children, and a little boy had in his hands
        a kind of club, a little stick, so he passed by and saw her lying so he struck
        her over her little head. So it was. I hear people running. People yell, “Mara
        is injured, Mara F. has been injured.” I go inside. She lies in a puddle of
        blood. He has struck her with the stick over the head. Possibly she got a
        fracture of the skull. Others told me that one of the gendarmes did it. An
        anti-Semite. While she was sleeping he passed by with a club and hit her over
        the head.

        this happened the 29th or 30th. I don’t know exactly. They were led out on
        the square for deportation, to death. Yes. They were led out at six o’clock,
        so I thought they will stand there and hour, and they will embark them into
        the trains. Doomed. They will be deported. So they were kept there from six
        in the morning until seven in the evening. It was 40 degrees of heat [Footnote:
        centigrade]. Bees burned to death in the air. Hot! It was so hot that men
        fainted and they herded them together under the open sky, under the open sky
        in the field behind the wires; and from the place where they were standing
        it was about hundred and fifty meters to our barracks.'

      u: Not a single German did I see. I didn’t see them. [The next few words are
        not clear] There was only one German officer from the Gestapo with one soldier.
        With his ... [she hesitates] gun on the side and watching how the French handled
        the people. And at a table in the front sat many militia men. There stood
        boxes, large one, and the people had to step forward and hand over their money
        at the desk. Do you understand? And they cut open the valises of the people
        and looked for money and other things. They cut open the feather beds, the
        pillows. The foolish people had dragged their feather beds with pillows, so
        they cut them open. They thought if they take the feather beds and the pillows,
        they will have it soft to sleep, but they were cut up, and the field looked,
        in July, as if it were winter. There was a snowfall of feathers. A snowfall
        of feathers. By seven o’clock in the evening the people were registered. And
        they were led away from the square. I too gave my child... I had some eau
        de cologne. I gave her some drops to take on the train, so she made signs
        to me from a distance. We were not permitted to go near them. All day already
        they would not permit the people who remained in the barracks to come near
        to these who were assigned for deportation. “Mother,” she yelled, “they take
        everything away.” I heard it. Not a little bottle, not a little knife, not
        a comb, not even a pin in the head.

      u: Not of the women. Not here in France, only of the men. Their hair was cut
        when they arrived in Auschwitz. They took away the pins from their heads,
        a comb [next word is not intelligible], a little knife, a... a fork, whatever
        they had of these things —— everything was taken away. My child showed me
        from a distance that she pours out the eau de cologne from the bottle and
        washes her head with it so that I should see it. “Mother”, she shouted, “my
        eau de cologne they cannot pour on themselves. I am washing my head with it,
        with that eau de cologne, and the flask with the drops you have given I have
        smashed myself.” And she points at her hair. They have taken away the pins
        from their hair [pause] And so from a distance with her hands. “Au revoir,
        Maman. Courage. I am already sacrified. See that you should save yourself
        with the two little ones. I give myself up already as a sacrifice.” [The next
        few words are not intelligible.] And so she departed with her suitcase and
        with her bundle from the square AND UP TO THIS DAY I HAVE NOT SEEN MY CHILD.
        ALREADY FOR FOUR DARK YEARS... [a long pause ]. They were deported on a Thursday.
        And Saturday evening there happened a miracle. I hear that here comes a man
        and calls my name. It has been written about it in the papers. I got out that
        day, one in twenty thousand. Fania F., Mara F., Max F. What happened? I have
        sent out a little message from the lager with some person to my husband. “You
        should know. Try. If you are not going to do something we shall be deported
        with the children to Auschwitz.” And the letter arrived. It has cost hundreds
        of French francs and a French gendarme has carried it out [apparently the
        letter]. If one would give him a hundred francs he would take out a letter,
        throw it in the mail box, and it would get to the people. And when I wrote
        the letter, the letter arrived, and my husband managed to get from the prefecture
        the paper that they should let me out with my children.

        out diamonds, Jewelry or such things, but we did not take anything like that

        “Does Charlotte F. live here?” I said “Yes.” My child was in bed sleeping.
        It was eight o’clock in the morning. What has happened? A French woman has
        reported on her that she went to Etoile [Footnote: The most famous park in
        the city of Paris] and she doesn’t carry the yellow star and she goes to the
        movies. Don’t you know it was regulated when to go to the store. Children
        couldn’t go out to play. You could buy things only between one and two, and
        in the afternoon from three to four. Summertime we had to lock ourselves in
        at eight o’clock. We could not go out in the street. One couldn’t go out to
        a railroad station. The Jew could not go out in the large parks. In the first
        class car of the metro [Footnote: The subway in Paris has cars of first and
        second class.] the Jew had no right to travel. On the railroad a Jew could
        not travel. So the man says, “Yes, you know you have been reported, that you
        are not carrying your star and you go to the movies and you are a Jewess,
        and that is prohibited to you.”'

      u: Yes. I was very upset. That was still before the rest of the family were
        taken to the concentration camp. That was three weeks before. That was in
        June and we were later taken in July. He says, “You have time, don’t hurry.
        Drink your coffee. Don’t hurry. It isn’t so bad. A Frenchwoman has reported
        that you don’t wear your star, that you go to the movies. Well, you will explain
        and they will let you go.” Well, I made coffee for my child. It was her last
        coffee with me. And the man was joking and laughing. To him it was a kind
        of an every day event, just as lighting a cigarette. To take a Jewish child
        out of bed, eight o’clock in the morning. To take her to the German commandant,
        like into hell, where the Gestapo people were sitting with their rubber truncheans
        beating and killing. She got dressed and left. When she arrived she found
        there some other people who had been arrested, Jewish people who had also
        been reported by the French. From there they were soon sent away to a prison.
        I was running around a day, two, three, four, nobody would tell me where my
        child was. I went to the prefecture. I ran here, I ran there. Nobody wants
        to tell me where she is. Through hard efforts I find out where she is. I arrived
        there with a package of food, to pass it on to her because for the three days
        that the child was away she had nothing to eat, no money, no food, nothing.
        And they don’t let me even hear her, just like she would be the greatest criminal,
        the worst murderer. What has she done? She didn’t wear the Jewish star. If
        one would carry on the street a star, and one point would not be so straight,
        they would tear it off and deport the person to Auschwitz. At last I found
        my child. I passed on to her the package of food, but they do not permit me
        to see her. Just like a murderer. On the third, fourth day I brought her a
        change of clothes. She left the house well dressed with a hat on her head,
        dressed very elegantly. They passed on to me her things. I gave her other
        things, and so four days had passed. Then I received a letter I should come
        and look for her in such and such a place. Finally I managed to arrange to
        meet her. And so I was admitted. Here I entered. So I say, “What is happening,
        Sulamith?” [Her Hebrew name is Sulamith.] What has happened to my child? What
        is the offense?” “Yes,” she says, “Mother, a Frenchwoman has tattled on me
        that I have not been wearing the Jewish Star and that I was going to the movies,
        and that is why I am in prison.” She was sent away to the... prison that had
        been a big armory. I did not find my daughter alone. I found about five hundred
        or six hundred people!

      u: No, we could give them everything. There were gendarmes and police who watched,
        of course, trying to catch a word of the conversation. There were spies among
        them; also Gestapo agents. There was among them a German woman from the Gestapo
        (which they found out later) but they did not know then that she was from
        the Gestapo. They thought she was also a prisoner, and she was assigned to
        spy after the young girls who were possible mixed up in politics or similar
        affairs, or who were talking against Germany or such things. When I came I
        found that my child was also so foolish. “Mother, you see, this woman is a
        very fine, a very decent woman. She too is a prisoner like myself.” So I say
        to her, “My child, my dear child. You are so naive. Don’t you recognize that
        she is from the Gestapo? She being a German? She is here to spy after you.
        In case you say a word that is not just so and they will put you in the lock-up.”
        And I made it clear to her that one should not talk about improper things.
        “And with that woman you should not talk at all. Neither should your good
        friends talk to her”.... So she tells me that the woman is a prisoner, and
        her husband is a prisoner, and he was among the men and she among the women.
        And such foolish children could not understand that these two people were
        employees of the Gestapo. Do you understand? In all the child was there two
        weeks. In these two weeks we saw each other twice. I took to her some things.
        I took to her a package of food. She, alas, knew that they will be sent to
        Germany. There were some French gendarmes who had a bit of heart, so they
        told them, you should know that you will be sent from here to work in Germany.
        But there were exceptions, people who remained there for six months, and there
        were a few others who remained there for a year. But my child was just out
        of luck, she remained there only for two weeks, and she was deported.

        is admitted any more to them. They were taken to the third story, locked up,
        assigned for deportation. They are being held just like criminals. No families
        are admitted; they are not permitted to write..... We were running back and
        forth for a day and two until I broke down with the bundle in my hand. I knew
        that my child is very much in need of things to wear. I run with the bundle
        here. I run with the bundle there. I turn to one inspector, I turn to another
        policeman, again to a police officer. I run from one office to another office.
        I fall to their feet, I kiss their hands. “My child is bare and naked; let
        me in with the package. She is being deported I know tomorrow or the day after
        tomorrow. Let me pass to her a pair of shoes. She has no shoes; a dress, something
        to eat.” They have received orders from the Gestapo as to those people who
        have been assigned for deportation, not to pass even a needle. And like myself
        many hundreds have turned around with their bundles, getting nowhere. And
        the next day we came and they were not there anymore. We were told that they
        were sent away to Drancy. From Drancy they were to be deported to Auschwitz.
        And so a day passed and behold I receive a letter, and the letter was from
        my child. She managed to obtain a scrap of paper and a pencil and when they
        put them on the train for deportation she managed to write down a few words
        to her mother. To her mother, she knew that we all were still home. And so
        she writes: “My dear parents: We are being deported en direction inconnu.”
        Do you know what that means? We are being deported to an address unknown,
        inconnu. “We are being transported like cattle in locked cars. We have no
        food, nor drink; we have no things. However, our morale is good, and we are
        strong. I am in the best of health. Don’t cry, Mother, and tell the children
        not to cry. I am young and I will come through. I am young and I hope we will
        see each other again. I kiss you. And see that you do not fall into the hands
        of the Germans. Hide yourselves. Get away from Paris. Hide in a village. Hide
        so they should not trap you as they have trapped me. And I hope we will see
        each other and I will come through because I am young.” And to this day I
        have not seen my child. Four dark years have passed, and I don’t know where
        her bones rest.'

      u: The letter carrier brought it to me. She threw the letter out from the moving
        train, and the people who work on the tracks found the letter and dropped
        it in the mail box. And the letter was delivered. I had the letter but there
        were constant raids by the Germans. They used to search around the house for
        various papers. My husband said, “I am afraid to keep such a letter. We can
        all be killed for such a letter. Because if they are in the train they are
        not permitted to write any more.” So my husband took the letter and burned
        it. It was the first and the last message I had from my child, written in
        German. She wrote German beautifully. And this is the way I lost my two daughters.
        And I am now here, with my husband, and my husband is sick, 99% sick, and
        this is the end of life. We have no courage, We have no morals. Lest the world
        will intervene and we shall be able to return to life again. Otherwise we
        are doomed.

        thousands of prisoners. These mattresses were soaked in tears. Dirty. These
        were mattresses packed with straw and dirty. The cots dirty. The place looked
        just like a place for horses — a stable. Each one occupied his cot. There
        was a trough like for horses. A trough. Everybody goes to it, lets run a little
        bit of water, washes off a bit of his grief. They bring up a kettle with some
        black water, give each one half a ladle of soup, of black water. It was supposed
        to be coffee, and maybe once it was coffee. The next morning they bring a
        kettle with a bit of soup. They give each one a ladle of soup, each one gets
        one potato, and one hundred grams of bread for twenty-four hours.

      u: 'Yes. People, young people. Like sheer skeletons. They cannot stand on their
        feet. They have kept them for six, seven weeks in those lagers and did not
        give them more than five or six times to eat. Young people. When they were
        brought into Drancy they told us that they were now in a paradise. When they
        got a little bit of soup and something was spilled on the floor, they would
        get down on all fours and lick up that soup from the mud. They were crazy
        from starvation, plain crazy. Their things were so messed up that one could
        not recognize whether they are clothes, whether they are rags. They have slept
        in them six or seven weeks. These were people who were caught on the street
        in Free France and they were not permitted to take anything from home, but
        [were dragged] straight from the streets into the trucks. And from the trucks
        they were taken to prison, and I forgot already what the name of that lager
        was. But from the lager they were taken to Drancy, and from Drancy they were
        deported to Germany. And such people were taken to work when they didn’t even
        have strength to lift their feet, to get into railroad cars. Young beautiful
        children. Eighteen, twenty years old. All emaciated and crazy from starvation.
        Insane from starvation. If they noticed a little piece of turnip on the floor
        it was as if they had found a piece of the best chocolate, [they would pick
        up ] a leaf of putrid lettuce, and they kissed our hands [pleading ]: “A little
        piece of bread.” Because we were still fresh, we were there only eight days.
        We had taken something from home. We still had something to eat, and we gave
        them. We shared with them, but one couldn’t give away everything. We did not
        know yet that we will go free. And although we knew that they will be deported
        we had to save something for our children. And so we saw two transports go
        away. Dead people shoved into cars and deported. Why did they have to deport
        them to Germany? To bury them? They could bury them here. Dead, young exhausted
        skeletons. And so things went on. They cooked a kettle for them. They gave
        each one a little ration of beans for their journey, for their trip to Auschwitz.
        A little piece of bread, a little piece of cheese was given to them, and they
        were pushed into railroad cars and they were sent away to Germany. I saw myself
        with my own eyes how they dragged out of Drancy for deportation ninety-year-old
        women. The police supported them under the arms because they couldn’t drag
        their legs. And they put them up in line for the count. Women with children!
        I saw little girls, little boys, who went with their mothers into the cars
        and they were sent away to Germany. And so I saw in those eight days deported
        from Drancy possibly a hundred thousand people. At the time of the third transport
        there came an order that all families of those men who worked for the Germans
        should be freed. Now the French wanted to appear nice since the people who
        would leave now would start telling. So they told us [she speaks in a mocking
        tone ], “You are going free. What a pity of these people who remain. Give
        them your food. You are now going home. They are being sent away. They are
        being deported. One cannot tell how long they will be en route.” So we should
        given them the food that we had. They tried to appear decent so that when
        we should go out we would say, “The French are nice people. They have told
        us to give away our food.” Do you understand?'

        were deported. A number of women of my acquaintances, many with infants, many

      u: 'No. Almost nobody has returned. In our neighborhood there were two hundred
        families. There have returned as follows: a man, a woman — Monsieur so and
        so [this is not clear], Madame so and so — and nobody else has returned. A
        single man and a single women from our house. Two prisoners [of war ] have
        returned who were taken prisoners and were held in Germany. Of all those who
        were taken prisoners in Germany only four thousand have returned. And that
        is how things happened. We were taken to be released through a small gate
        and from the other side people were led into the railroad cars for deportation.
        That is how things came to pass Monsieur Professor. Here were people standing
        for deportation and we were led out, all those who had been arrested and had
        certificates that they were working for the Germans, which were about sixty
        or seventy families. They let us all go. This was not to the liking of the
        French. They were wondering, “What for do we need Jews? If they have already
        been arrested, to let them out again, what’s that?” We told then that the
        Germans have done that for us. We were interested to hear what they would
        have to say because our men were not afraid of them. “Our men are working
        for the Germans and that is why we were released”. They were such anti-Semites,
        and they could not savor it. And so I got out with my two children, Monsieur
        Professor. I spent a few months at home, and again they came pounding at the
        door. The Germans had bad luck. They didn’t need anymore fur jackets, they
        didn’t need anybody anymore to work for them, but what they did need was that
        all people who did work for them should go to Auschwitz. All of them. And
        so the third time (the good angel wanted it that way), we didn’t sleep at
        home. We slept in another house.'

      u: As soon as we were freed there started something with the partisans. With
        the boys and with the girls, the civilian volunteers. When the Americans came
        in, these young boys and young girls went to the police, (the partisans occupied
        the police stations), saying it was important to free the Jews, to free them
        from concentration camps, to free them from Germany, and so they went as far
        as Germany, as far as the concentration camps to set them free from there.
        So these young boys, the partisans went there and in this way thousands of
        these young boys were killed.

      u: As I say, the Jews got killed. What did they get for it? THEY HAVE NO LAND,
        AND THEY HAVE NO SAND [soil] The Gentiles were killed so they know what for.
        They died to free their country. Their France. But the Jews, they killed off
        their boys, they killed off their men, thousands of them fell, and do you
        think it has become easier? No, it is the same story, it was not worth the
        fight. What do I have to fight for, Monsieur Professor? I am pleading with
        you. You will come to America, tell them what a foolish woman has told you,
        that the French envy if the Jew accomplishes something. Do you understand?
        The anti-Semitism that we have seen from them, their militia, their beatings,
        their exploitation, they were worse than the Germans. I speak only about France.
        What happened in Germany I don’t know. I have not seen it.

      u: Yes, I know, but I am talking about France. If the French would not have
        helped the Germans, the Germans would not have abducted from here some one
        hundred fifty thousands. Maybe they would have taken fifty thousands, but
        not one hundred fifty thousand. Do you understand? It was they who told them
        [the Germans] here is a Jew, and here lives a Jew. There walks a Jew and there
        walks a Jew. They were the ones who let them in. Take them, and for money
        and for everything they betrayed us.

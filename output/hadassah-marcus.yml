        out of giant transports nobody, nobody was let in alive into the lager. Children

        burning only weak people, the living witnesses can tell that they took away
        from us the most beautiful, the youngest, the healthiest people, who were
        still sufficiently capable and strong for work. There was a time when they
        installed a children’s block. The children were given of the finest and the
        best, but it was only when they had to present proof for an inspection or
        such. During one nice, bright morning the children were taken away and all

      u: In the year 1945...it was also on the 18th, 1st month, i.e., the 18th of
        January, when the Russians were already standing behind our backs. We were
        aroused from sleep in the middle of the night, and we had to march on foot.
        In that night we covered thirty kilometers, without any rest, running, not
        walking. We weren’t give anything for the road. We were told to take along
        our Kotzen, but we had to throw it away in the middle of the road, because
        the [our] strength had given out.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Polish Jews who had money could hope to bribe their way out of painful
      situations during the early years of German rule. But wealth by no means assured
      escape from the Nazi net. Hadassah Marcus’s family was prominent in Warsaw’s
      gem and precious metals trades, which gave them skills and access to valuables
      that helped them avoid deportation until near the end of the Warsaw ghetto in
      1943. But whatever remained of their wealth probably disappeared in the ransoming
      of Marcus’s husband from the SS torture squads. In hiding during the last days
      of the ghetto, she and her family were betrayed by other Jews, and she and a
      younger sister were sent to Majdanek, where they were assigned to the work crew
      building the crematorium. She was twenty-nine at the time. </p><p>After three
      months at Majdanek the sisters were moved to Auschwitz, arriving at a very “lucky
      moment” indeed; by summer 1943 the camp had temporarily run short of laborers,
      and the mass exterminations had been suspended. They managed to stay together
      and were assigned to the justly feared task of clearing aquatic vegetation from
      fish ponds near the camp. One of Marcus’s deepest impressions of Auschwitz was
      the gassing in 1944 of large numbers of children held at the family camp at
      Birkenau. Postwar research has confirmed her impression that they had been kept
      alive solely to deceive the Red Cross, which had been pressing for an opportunity
      to inspect Auschwitz. Once the Red Cross dropped its demands—perhaps satisfied
      with what the Germans showed its representatives at the model Theresienstadt
      ghetto, or else caving in to German resistance—the children and the adults who
      lived with them in the family camp were liquidated.</p><p>The sisters managed
      to stay together during the last months of the war as they were sent to Ravensbrück,
      the German concentration camp for women, and then to one of its satellite work
      camps northwest of Berlin. There they were liberated, twice, in a sense, first
      by the Americans and then by the Soviets. They returned to Poland and settled
      in Łódź where Hadassah organized a Zionist kibbutz for the orthodox Agudat Israel,
      which was then shedding its earlier opposition to Jewish nationalism. There
      she ran into revived Polish anti-Semitism and encountered opposition from the
      official Central Committee of the Jews in Poland, sponsored by the new Communist
      government and dedicated to persuading Jews to stay and (as they confidently
      hoped at the time) help build a new Poland free from racial strife.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.
      Hadassah M. was interviewed at a home for displaced Jews at Hénonville, about
      thirty miles from Paris. Still a passionate Zionist, she managed the camp kitchen
      for her own large kibbutz and a Lithuanian yeshiva located there.</p>\n"

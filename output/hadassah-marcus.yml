        with large dogs, with rifles ready, we were led to Majdanek, which is a few
        kilometers from Lublin. When we arrived in Majdanek we were the first transport

        which has strong winds, unheard of, or great heats. Throughout the night a
        frost [snow?] of ten centimeters [ thick ] lay on the ground. They examined
        our feet, if we didn’t put a piece of paper underneath. Afterwards, in the
        morning, we had to run, not walk, to work, chased after by a young female
        SS man with a giant dog. Her name was Brigida.

        clothes torn off. And when one returned to the lager bitten, the next day
        he was taken to the crematory, because people who weren’t completely well,

        defense whatsoever. They would absolutely be unable to disclaim anything against
        us. Because it couldn’t be imagined that we will be let out at liberty, and
        what such living witnesses could give the world. There were also cases that
        out of giant transports nobody, nobody was let in alive into the lager. Children
        were altogether out of the question. If they want to claim that they were
        burning only weak people, the living witnesses can tell that they took away
        from us the most beautiful, the youngest, the healthiest people, who were
        still sufficiently capable and strong for work. There was a time when they
        installed a children’s block. The children were given of the finest and the
        best, but it was only when they had to present proof for an inspection or
        such. During one nice, bright morning the children were taken away and all
        burned.

        for us, and we began to do our work. Because we saw that we have to create
        a home for those people who are returning now from the lagers, who were greatly

        a home for all those who were completely alone after returning from the lagers.

      u: We saw to it that as far as possible we should be able to send people out
        of Poland, there where our air is, to Eretz Yisroeil. Because in spite of
        all we didn’t have a peaceful life in Poland. A Jew couldn’t go peacefully
        out in the street. There had begun again carnages and again slaughters.

      u: How do you explain it? The Poles wanted to be free of the Germans. They knew
        that the German was attacking the Jews. How does it come that a Pole should
        do the same thing?
    - who: Hadassah Marcus
      start: '00:43:40.085'
      end: '00:44:06.611'
      u: That’s hopeless. He [the German] has left a legacy which, it seems like,
        will remain in Poland, in spite of the government being strongly against it.
        But it isn’t strong enough to stand up against the dark masses which still
        reign and maintain themselves in Poland. And before Pesach [Passover] we succeeded
        in tearing ourselves through and coming to France.

        all that is ill in Poland, all that, is being reconstructed. Jewish hands
        are doing the reconstruction. Without us they know they won’t accomplish anything.

      u: If one should want to relate the details, say about what one had lived through
        in one minute, one can sit and write a whole year. I figure that from the
        collected materials the world should know, and she can already form a picture
        [of] what had happened with us. And now the whole world should stand open
        for us with all...with all the forces with which they can help...help us so
        that we could arrive in Eretz Yisroeil. So that there we should be able to
        live our life fully and at least feel at home. Because no matter where it
        should be, we won’t be able to find peace. America is not for us. Belgium
        is not for us. The whole world is not for us, because there...there we won’t
        feel secure. We don’t demand much happiness from life any more, because we
        had too much unhappiness. We already have given too much of our share to the
        world. But still, now we want a peaceful life and for once to feel what it
        means to be in one’s home [homeland].

      start: '00:49:17.319'
      end: '00:49:27.594'
      u: Maybe, because of that, we should be able to carry the responsibility for
        the generations which will come, that to them shouldn’t happen any more what
        has happened to us.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:49:27.594'

        want that one should do for you?
    - who: Hadassah Marcus
      start: '00:49:38.935'
      end: '00:50:22.870'
      u: The world should see to fight that for us should be opened the gates of Eretz
        Yisroeil. We demand nothing more. We still are quite capable people. The world
        shouldn’t think that that we are crippled, backward [?]. There is yet much
        energy in us, because there is the will for revenge in us, which we cannot
        use up, because we are not able to. We have to do too much and work too much
        and shed too much blood, so that our Jewish consciecce and our Jewish heart
        should be able to carry that out. Or led the world carry that out. Let the
        world take revenge on those who have ruined us completely.

        they took everything away from us. We went in naked, and we were given already
        their clothing so that I don’t have their address. I would want very much

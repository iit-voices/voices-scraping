        I have to leave this town at five to get to Frankfurt and then to Paris. [unintelligible]
        a bit personal. It is the last day of my work in Germany...which to a large
        extent, I have officially to be thankful to the UNNRA, and unofficially to
        our friend, Jack Thompson, of the Chicago Tribune, who has done so much to
        realize, to help me to realize this project.

      u: 'In 1939, September 1st, I was still with my parents together in Kielce.
        My father was an important citizen in Kielce for about thirty-five years.
        Together with us on the night of Friday- from Thursday to Friday it was- there
        happened to be with us my brother from Potianice and a child of my oldest
        sister, a grandchild twelve years old. At six o’clock in the morning the first
        bombs fell over Kielce. I went down with my parents into the cellar, but my
        father did not want to go. He said: “From this one cannot hide in the cellar.”
        Then he “said” a chapter from the Psalms. My youngest brother was in the war
        on the Polish side. And with it I thought that the world had come to an end.
        To lose my youngest brother! I did not want to live any more. So naive I was
        then, to think that all I would lose in the war was my youngest brother. Once
        during the first days of September I got up especially early—five o’clock
        in the morning. There wasn’t a single German to be seen on the street. So
        I said: “Mother, dear, maybe it was only a dream. Maybe they are really not
        here.” Unfortunately, it was not a dream.. They were there, and they were
        there for a long time. My father had to leave his home to hide somewhere in
        the suburb. The Gestapo was looking for him. I remained alone with my mother
        in five rooms, and all through the night I was clinging to the window, running
        around in search. Where are the people who used to come every night- every
        evening- to see my father? Where are the grandchildren, who are afraid to
        cross the street and to come upstairs? Nobody was there.'

      u: In November I departed with my parents from...(name of locality incomprehensible).
        We were told there was a prisoners’ camp—Pshemish. I went across to the Russian
        side. I was not far from Grodno, and there I found everybody alive, and I
        looked for a place where I could bring over my parents. But in March it was
        already too late to bring somebody over, and so I remained in Grodno. Among
        the Russians the Jews lived just like all the other peoples.

      u: In Grodno the Jews lived just like the other people. First there were those
        who lived in Poland before, and then there were those who came from the zone
        occupied by the Germans. And they all lived together. Some lived in the synagogues
        or in the streets, but still they all lived together. Somehow I adjusted myself
        in Grodno. One has to live. The only thing was the terrible worry about my
        parents, and the homesickness. And all day and all night fire was pouring
        over Grodno, and within a single twenty-four hours sixty per-cent of the city
        was destroyed; and we remained alive. I lived on a street in No. 9; No. 11
        burned down. No’s. 27,23, and 9- I remained alive. At No. 11 and at one side
        of No. 9, there fell a bomb, destroying everything. I remained alive- and
        again there came the Germans. In a monstrous fashion they chased people through
        the streets, and it soon started all over. This was in the East, with special
        laws. In a few days I got the idea that my husband was alive.

      u: No. At that time there came people who were together with him- with my man.
        And so they first brought me an idea.. [She apparently has used the Hebrew
        word “yidie” which means “message”.] And my man succeeded in “blacking himself
        across.” *The word “black” is a designation for illegal action, as in “black
        market” or “black papers,” and it has become a verb- to do something illegal
        is often spoken of as “to black.” *, to Wolkowysk and to mingle in with other
        prisoners. He had an uncle there, and so we got together. During the summer
        they still let us live in our apartment, although my husband had to work very
        hard, from six o’clock in the morning until six o’clock at night, together
        with all the others. And we still had at home some belongings, and we sold
        them, and we ate, and we hoped that possibly we might survive. The first of
        November we were driven into the Ghetto.

      u: In Grodno, into the ghetto. They arranged two ghetto, one in Slobodka [The
        name Slobodka often is used to designate the poorer suburbs, or slums.] and
        one ghetto in the yard of the synagogue. At the beginning, the day when we
        came to the ghetto the wires were not ready, and it did not make such a terrible
        impression. But the next day everything was fenced up and there was an inscription
        on the gate- “From here one does not return.”...[She is very much upset and
        for the next two sentences the wire is not clear.] We have learned that the
        Jew should never give up hope, and his spirit should never falter. But the
        heart was heavy. It was hard to bear. I was in my ninth month. We used to
        live like affluent citizens, my father-in-law, my man, and my sister-in-law.
        Now we were given a room of eight and one-half cubic meters,— no, squares;
        I don’t know how many cubic meters there were. And there I was to give birth
        to my child. One day they opened the ghetto, and every Jew was permitted to
        go into his home to fetch some things. Then my father-in-law went back to
        his home, and he saw the destruction of the home for which he has been working
        for thirty-years- and he returned gravely ill. He never got well again.

        few bundles in our hands. And everything else had to be left. And the people,
        of course, who lived around- what did they care about the Jews! They just
        waited for such a moment. They went inside. The things of value the Gestapo
        themselves hauled away. My father-in-law had been working hard all his life,
        and when he saw what had become of his home, he took badly sick, and he remained
        sick up until the end. The 26th of November I gave birth to my child in the
        ghetto in my room, because there was not yet a Jewish hospital. The doctor-
        and everybody—tried to comfort me. On the third day after my child was born,
        we were informed that we would be driven into barracks to Kelbasin, six kilometers
        away from Grodno. There were seventy thousand Russian prisoners, and after
        six weeks there remained only six thousand. To such a place they wanted to
        drive us away.

        year later were in Kelbasin, and there they died by the thousands. In the
        middle of Kelbasin there was an open pit, where they would throw the children,
        and they did not cover it up until it was full. Dead Jewish children. We did
        not go then to Kelbasin. They let us stay in the ghetto for a year.

      u: There was a Jew from Kielce in Slonim, a son of a very prominent, wealthy
        man from Kielce, Chaim Zagalski, with his daughter; he ran away from Kielce,
        and they were heard of from Slonim. And we sent a man from Grodno to bring
        him over. So he found the door nailed shut, the house empty; Chaim Zagalski
        was not there any more. There were left in Slonim about two hundred Jews,
        out of a population of nine thousand Jews before the start of the slaughter,
        or possibly even more- I don’t know. There were a lot of refugees from districts
        previously doomed by the Germans. I did not know the district of Slonim. There
        was a great Slonim rabbi, whose name I don’t know. And these two hundred Jews
        had numbers hung on them (the Christians made them wear them), and they had
        to report every day to the square, an place of roll call, and they were sent
        to work. Work! We too had worries about work! The day my man was working,
        we had hope to survive that day. But when people came to the gates of the
        ghetto and said, “no more work required,” that was a dark day. We knew it
        was coming. November 1, 1942, the ghetto was surrounded. Every few steps stood
        an armed German, with his gun ready, and at some distance on the hill machine
        guns. They told us nothing, but they took us “to work.” We knew what that
        meant. And nearby were Russians, Poles; not all but many were waiting for
        what they could inherit from the Jews. Possibly they had waited so that in
        case the Germans themselves would not put an end to us, they could step in.

        Brest-Litovsk and other Ukranian cities. And in Russia, as far as Stalingrad
        and the Ural [mountains], the Germans did it themselves. They could not relinquish
        the “sacred labor”, and they had their mission. However, it did not start
        that day, nor later. With a sadistic forethought, they told us: “Have no care,
        this will become a labor lager, my word of honor.” said Herr Ehrlich, the
        Gestapo chief, to the Community Council. “Mass murder! Oh, no; that is out
        of the question- deportation, neither!! It will be converted into a work-lager,
        no more loafing. And believe me, my word of honor.” Believe his word of honor!
        In two weeks it started. First we saw them transporting the inhabitants of
        the smaller towns, from Slobodka,—on horse carts, old, broken down, sick people,
        and on foot the young ones; towards Bialystok they were led. And when they
        were through with the small towns, it commenced in Grodne. First came Slobodka.
        The first street....my father,—that is, my father-in-law,—I must save my child.
        Possibly we should get away at night to some Poles, old acquaintances, and
        hide there. My husband, myself, my sister-in-law, and a girl friend who was
        with us, we shall get away to the partisans, and Father with the child should
        remain with the Poles. But he refused. And so it was. He resigned himself
        to death. To me he said: “Take the child and save yourselves. Go to the other
        ghetto. There they are still allowed to remain.” I was the first to go over
        to the second ghetto with the child. In a few days came my man. Father told
        him: “For the sake of the child, go!” He himself remained there. His younger
        daughter Zina- he could not abandon her, and they both went off with a transport,
        most probably to Treblinka. Within a week they started the ghetto in the yard
        of the synagogue. The most horrible was that the Jewish Police (at the beginning
        we were not told about the horrible role they would have to play) they came
        and led us, assembled for the slaughter there, to the synagogue, at night.
        Every few nights we would sit up—I, my man (the child was asleep, all dressed,
        and we expected the police to come after us. Every night we said Vida (the
        prayer of those who expect to die) of our own composition, and forgave each
        other, but they did not come. My man worked then as a carpenter (he is a lumber
        sorter by trade), and this kept us there. Once my man said: “I can’t make
        peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. We have
        nobody any more. You look like a Christian; get out with the child. Put it
        next to a Christian orphanage. Orphans also may be lucky sometimes. I can’t
        want her to die.” It snowed that night. It was 25 degrees cold. [Below zero
        centigrade.] Sixteen Jews fell at the gate in the first attempt to escape.
        I went over the wires in the second attempt, and my man handed me the child,
        and I carried her away.'

      u: 'No, then they had no electric wires. He handed me the child. And I went
        out in the street. I removed the yellow patch, and I went down the street.
        It was eight o’clock. At nine o’clock it was curfew hour. I did not know where
        to go. All at once I remembered a Christian woman whom I happened to know,
        and I went to her and said: “This is all that I have got; take the child and
        carry it to an orphanage. Say, you have found it in the street. I am returning
        to my man, and we shall perish together.” She started to wring her hands,
        a Christian woman whom I had possibly seen only twice before. And she said:
        “I am afraid (the Poles were threatened with death for such things); put her
        in the street. I will come out of the house with a neighbor woman; we shall
        come out as if by accident. I will pick up the child and take her tomorrow
        to the orphanage, but you go away immediately.” And so she has taken my child.
        I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden
        in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow. And here, I could
        not pick her up, the child that I had brought into the world! I knew that
        that will save her life. That is what I hoped. [A few words in this sentence
        are not clear. She is sobbing, and even by slowing down the wire and listening
        to this section over and over, I have been able to understand only about three
        words. I do not think that the translation of the phrase “the child I brought
        into the world” is entirely correct.] In a few minutes she came out of the
        house and picked up the child. I ran away through the streets of Grodno, and
        I didn’t think of the curfew—that I might be caught,—and I didn’t know how
        to get back to the ghetto, as it was such a late hour. There was a Christian
        woman in the city, with whom I had once worked during the time of the Soviets.
        I stepped in to her, and a girl friend of mine was hiding there. I entered
        the house, and I said, “Panuvka *This is a respectful and at the same time
        endearing name for a Polish woman. *, I don’t have my child any more. How
        light my hands feel!” Then she said, “Twenty-six hours you have suffered to
        bring her into the world, and now you will suffer as long as you live.” I
        didn’t ask her for much—just to keep me over night. She couldn’t help me for
        much longer, because on Sunday no one could show himself in the city. The
        Germans were grabbing the people and dragging them to work in Germany. I wanted
        to return to the ghetto. Then thousand Jews were deported that day. The ghetto
        was surrounded. One couldn’t get in, nor could one get out. Part were going
        to Treblinka, and to get in one also didn’t know how. I ran into a Christian—he
        was a working man. [Recording not clear.] I told him I am a Jewess—”I can’t
        get into the ghetto.” And he said, “Get out of the city. You do not look Jewish.
        Go where ever you can, but don’t remain here. You see here it burns.” And
        so I departed alone, without papers, into the woods. I did not know the roads.
        Through the woods, into a Russian village. I entered. “Give me some water.”
        If one is alive, one has to drink water. And sometimes one has to eat. Everybody
        gave me something. I did not look Jewish, but they knew—what else could be
        driving me in the snow through the woods? Everyone kept me for one night.'

        was a preacher—A Christian, a Catholic. He hid me “for strength” for eight
        days. But it drove me back to Grodno to find out what was going on. The priest
        encountered some Jews that were going to work. She he asked them: “Do you
        know whether Jack Kovitzki is there?” So they said: “He is there, he has remained
        alive.” Three thousand Jews were still in Grodno. So he said, “Tell him that
        his wife is alive—that she does not want to remain among us. She wants to
        go back, and in a few days she will be back.” The next week he took me out
        part of the way in a cart—to go further, he was afraid. And I went alone towards
        Grodno—I can’t remember how many kilometers. I arrived in Grodno. It’s the

        shooting and screaming. A new transport. And I and my husband went to this

        In the synagogue it was crowded—heavy and crowded. One could not breathe.
        The whole night without a drop of water, and outside the shooting. At two
        o’clock in the morning we were driven out to the train. And my husband said:
        “No, you are not going to die. Because you have returned to me, is that why
        you should perish?” And I said, “I cannot be—I am already tired. Maybe I shall
        rest in the grave.” But he did not wish to understand, and just one street
        away from the train he pushed me into a gate, in spite of the guards, because
        it was still dark. We remained standing in the gateway until morning. We both

        do not look Jewish.”—”Still I am Jewish.” But my man continued repeating that
        I was a Christian until they were taken by doubts. There was a Polish policeman
        present. WhiteRussians in dark blue uniforms. “Oh, so you are loving a Jew?”
        And I replied: “I am Jewish. I am not ashamed.” The whole night they kept
        us locked up, calling us out separately. My husband and then me alone, then
        both of us together. My husband whispered to me, “I plead with you, go try
        to live. Go back to Grodno. You will be a mother to the child. Maybe you will
        tell her some day that she had a father.” And I yielded, and I went out to
        live.'

        became completely hard. My legs were covered with boils. Then my illness from
        before—gall stones—In Auschwitz—in Auschwitz not to appear to the appell meant
        death, and still the supervisers of the barracks had pity on me and let me
        remain on the cot up to the last moment when already the SS men had come for
        roll call. Then they would drag me off the cot and lead me out. In Auschwitz
        I had a change of mind. I decided again to live. There appeared one day in
        my block a distant cousin of mine, a girl, Nelly Kovitzka, a seventeen-year
        old girl. Her face was that of my little girl. And I was overcome with hope
        I should return. Maybe she is alive...[three or four words unintelligible].

        I cleaned it, I scrubbed it, and for that I would get another helping of soup,
        and at times I would get a little piece of bread that the blokova would leave
        uneaten. Then in spite of curfew I dressed up. In Auschwitz there was enough
        to wear. There was the clothing of the dead. They were burning people every
        day. The whole night the ovens would flame, and the skies red, dark red, just
        like.... [the next word is not clear.] One night I was standing in front of
        the block. A Christian block trusty stood near by. That night they were burning

        not tattooed. They were assembled there, and then they all were burned. I
        don’t know. Possibly they were not even gassed, because of the horrible screams
        coming from there. Moreover one could somehow feel it. And there I was standing,
        and I mumbled to myself, and I said, “Dante was just a dog. They know it much
        better.” And the Christian woman heard it, and she said to me [and here she
        imitates a voice of extreme surprise], “You know about Dante? How do you come
        to know anything about Dante?” She thought that I always must have been looking
        like that—like in Auschwitz. And from that night we became friends.

        A Christian woman. She was a block
                                trusty. And she had the say over life and death. But she was a human being. Only afterwards I realized that she was a human being. In spite of the fact that she would beat us, and in spite of all that, she was fighting for the life of every prisoner. For the Christians she did not have to fight. Christians normally did not go to the ovens, only those who had died. But for the Jews she had to fight. Two years ago [this with some hidden light in her voice] on Rosh Hashona [the interview was taking place on Rosh Hashona of 1946, and she apparently refers to an incident exactly two years before] just two years ago, there was to be a selection. A selection was when they re-sorted the people—who for the ovens and who should stay alive. So she took all the weak and the sick, including myself, and sent them away outside the lager for work, Aussenkomando, so they should not be present for the “selection.” However, there was no selection afterwards. But I became convinced that she was really human, that if she mistreated and beat us, it was only because she herself wanted to survive and wanted us to survive.

        Yes, somebody came and told me; I went over there and managed to see them. But afterwards I did not believe that they were taken to a work camp, because nobody believes that one can come out alive from Auschwitz, although the Red Army was already at the gates of Warsaw. In September more transports were sent away, and we didn’t know where to. In October I decided to get away from Auschwitz. Be what it may, better come death, but no Auschwitz. To have to look on how living human beings stand in line waiting for death, and to say nothing, and they don’t even cry. They would not cry. Once the Christian block
                                trustys reproached me: “Why are they going with such indifference to death? Why don’t they fight? Why don’t they kill somebody?” So I replied, “You haven’t been in a ghetto. You have not seen how Jews went away in transports with congealed nerves [verglievert]. A human being can cry himself dry; a human being clings to life, and up to the last moment there is a ray of hope and they are defenseless. And they have no arms. How can you say that? Maybe you just want to soothe your conscience talking that way.” And the same day a miracle happened. The Jews seized the oven. They first threw in some forty SS men, and then, with them one hundred-fifty lost their lives, and a hundred-fifty ran away into the woods to the partisans. Of course, it was with help from outside, of partisans.- of Poles and other nationalities.

      u: 'Well, there would come transports of Jews from all over the world, and they
        did not know what their fate would be. So every woman still had these things.
        And they would lie on the dumps, and those who had access to the dumps would
        collect it and would give it to everyone who looked bad, to cover it up. And
        so I was heavily painted. One day they came to our block and told us that
        we are going to the transport—to lead us to a transport block. And I too was
        selected during the appell. And so we went to block 31, the transit block.
        Here we remained for eight days. Then there was a selection and we were sent
        to the shower bath. That was a bathing room, where people would bathe, and
        afterward everyone was looked over. For me that was very dangerous; so a woman,
        a block servant, told me: “Don’t go in there. Simply sneak out through the
        other side and stand up with those on the right side, because externally you
        look well.” And so I mingled in with three hundred other women, and I went
        away with a transport to Lippstadt. In Lippstadt there was work. In Auschwitz
        there was no work. In Lippstadt they manufactured ammunition, and there the
        strength to live returned to me. To work!—I should stamp cartridges for machine
        guns, with which the Germans would shoot (and these were the last munition
        factories) the Americans who came to liberate us! And because I looked so
        [decrepit] they thought that I was such a fool! In a few days I learned the
        mechanism of my machine, and in a few days I started to work very ardently.
        The assigned quota was twelve thousand, but I would produce fifteen thousand
        pieces. But fifteen thousand smaller ones and fifteen thousand larger ones,
        never the caliber that was prescribed. When they discovered it, there were
        eighty thousand rejected pieces. My foreman came over to me and said: “If
        you do it once more, I shall chop off your hand.” So I said, “Oh [here her
        voice becomes ironical, and she speaks in perfect German], you can report
        that I am doing sabotage? Then they make me altogether kaput.” “Oh, for that
        you are much too dumb!” I don’t know, maybe he had noticed what I was doing,
        but it may have been too late, and he already was responsible along with me.
        I can’t be so naive as to assume that the Germans wanted to cooperate with
        me against Hitler. Such do not exist. But to the last moment they had fate.
        In the faces of the Germans I read just like in a newspaper. They were very
        sad the last days. It was already the year 1945, in March. They still drove
        us to work, and they would beat us at every air raid alarm. But, thank God!
        The air raid alarm would last for twenty-four hours. They would run into the
        air raid shelter, and we would run right out into the yard. We would run out
        into the yard, and laugh, and the SS men would say to us: “Aren’t you afraid?
        Do you think that your friends will spare you?” [She continues with laughter
        in her voice] “You are afraid! Why aren’t you in the battlefield? All you
        are fighting with is eight hundred defenseless and weak women. That is the
        kind of heroes you are!” The girls thought that I was again insane, like I
        had been in Auschwitz. But it was indifferent to me. [Here again the record
        loses its clearness]. To die in such a fashion may be well worth while. The
        27th of March we were driven out of Lippstadt.'

        the SS men, and he himself ran away. So I said then to one of the girls, “You

      u: The Germans raised a white flag. The name of the town is Kaunitz, in Westphalia
        near Lippstadt, twenty-seven kilometers from Lippstadt. And here we were,
        almost crazy. We haven’t a strip of a white thing. Somebody had a bandage
        around a wounded leg, and that bandage was raised at an approaching American
        tank, and the women prostrated themselves on the ground, kissing the wheels.
        The Americans thought it was a house of the insane. They looked at us. [I
        am not sure of the correct translation of the next few sentences.] And how
        we looked! All in tatters. [Her words are barely audible.] And speaking—nobody
        could. We were all speechless. And then he understood, and two tears rolled
        down his face. [Again the text is not clear, she is very upset.] And until
        the others arrived, he wept with us. Not a Jew—a Christian. And then they
        began to arrive, the tanks. It was Passover. The last day of it. And matzos
        [Unleavened bread, eaten by Jews at Easter] fell from the tanks. And chocolate
        and cigarettes. And they would jump off the tanks and they were kissing us.
        Us dirty and lousy ones. “Do not weep,” they would say. But we wept more and
        again. And incessantly the tears ran. The Ninth Army had not seen any Jews
        in Germany, and we thought that we were the only Jewish survivors, and we
        did not want to live. But they consoled us. They were telling us that there
        were many other armies that have reached other lagers which were liberated.
        That was liberation. We were all dead sick. I was half swollen. Immediately
        the American army led us into homes. They burned everything we had on us,
        although we wanted to save the clothing. But it was all infected, and we were
        afraid to keep it. Dirty. And we changed our clothes, putting on whatever
        we could. We could take things, good things, from the Germans. We took it
        from the Germans [with irony in her voice], they gave it to us themselves.
        They were afraid now. We dressed [here her voice again breaks into sobs].
        We washed ourselves, with soap, warm water, a clean towel, pure underwear.
        [She uses the English word “pure”]. Oh! The Americans themselves were crazy
        with joy. They now understood—”You are going to liberate human beings.” And
        that army hadn’t seen before those who were liberated. We were the first ones,
        and they were rejoicing like little children. And in the evening one American
        put on his head a hat, a German hat, a womans hat, and another one played
        some kind of instrument, and he danced with a little girl from our lager.
        I shall not forget it, ever. [She weeps again and speaks in exhaustion.] For
        the first time we got into the lager a radio, and we heard the news. Bergen-Belsen
        liberated. Thirty thousand hopelessly sick. Thousands and thousands dead.
        Who knows whether my people were there? Everybody thought so, and their eyes
        would run out [in tears.] Buchenwald.

      u: 'The pictures she left with a woman friend of mine who was saved. She lived
        on “Aryan papers” near Grodno. About twelve kilometers from there. And this
        woman friend of mine went to this [Christian] woman and wanted to take my
        child back. So she gave her the pictures. And so I don’t have the child. Then
        there was a rumor that my husband was alive, Jacob Kovitzki. Somebody wrote
        from Kovno, but I didn’t know where he is, and a year has passed. I was unable
        to find him. Maybe he went into Russia, but so far there is nothing from him.
        Now I am working in Pfalzheim, in a kindergarten. There are twenty little
        Jewish children. And I play with them, and then I forget about all that. Again
        I have around me Jewish children. But after work, to come alone to my room—today
        is a holiday. Where are all mine, who used to celebrate the holidays with
        me? Thank God! There are Jews staying with me on a holiday. Not a holiday
        in Auschwitz. But my people are no more. I am alone. [This whole section on
        Spool 167 was spoken with sobs, which are clearly heard on the wire. The woman
        was very much beside herself. I had a hard time to keep her in line with the
        microphone, and now I don’t find a little episode which she told me, apparently
        after I had stopped the machine. It is not on the wire, but here it is, written
        from memory: “Last night, and that means on the first evening of Rosh Hashona
        we, like at home, prepared the holiday meal, and as was customary at home,
        we invited a soldier to share it with us. But this time it was not a poor
        soldier, away from home, who had to be fed, but an American Jewish soldier,
        who, accepting the invitation, brought us an armful of gifts, all kinds of
        American food and delicacies.”]'

  commentary:
    text: "<p>The Jews of eastern Poland were under Soviet rule for the first twenty-one
      months of the war and hence were spared Nazi persecution until Hitler turned
      eastward in June 1941. Anna Kaletska never made it clear where in Poland she
      and her husband lived before the war, although it is probable that it was in
      or near his parents’ hometown of Grodno in the northeast part of the country.<sup>1</sup>
      Evidently he was in the Polish army, and she was visiting her hometown of Kielce
      when the Germans attacked in 1939. Shortly after Poland surrendered, she made
      the 300-kilometer trip from Kielce to Grodno in the Soviet zone; such travel
      was still possible in the weeks immediately following the capitulation. In Grodno
      she was reunited with her husband, and there they experienced the second German
      onslaught in 1941.</p><p>Grodno sits on the ethnic border between Poland and
      Belorussia in an area of mixed languages and cultures. It had been part of Poland
      from 1919 to 1939 and then of the USSR until 1941, when the Germans annexed
      it to their province of East Prussia. At the beginning of November 1941 its
      25,000 Jews were herded into two ghettos, one for able workers in the synagogue
      quarter and the other for “nonproductive” Jews in the suburb of Slobodka. Shortly
      after the birth of their daughter, Anna and her husband managed to slip from
      Slobodka to the central ghetto and then to escape deportation, but someone denounced
      them to the Germans as they attempted to reach the partisans in the forest.
      They were separated, and Anna never saw her husband again. After surviving slave
      labor at Auschwitz and in Germany, she learned the tragic fate of her only child.</p><p>Kaletska’s
      interview is striking for what it says about Gentile willingness to help Jews
      in Grodno and its surrounding area. A woman she scarcely knew took in her baby
      and raised it as her own. Complete strangers gave her and her husband shelter
      as they fled the city. And yet, various other Gentiles turned them over to the
      Germans and later identified her baby as Jewish. One could never know. Although
      Anna probably could have passed as a Pole once she escaped from the Grodno ghetto,
      and had Gentile friends to boot, ties to her family and her community brought
      her back even when she had grounds to fear the worst from the Germans. Once
      in German hands, she was virtually forced to take on an “Aryan” identity, and
      actually did so for a while. But this time despair and perhaps even the wish
      to die compelled her to reassert her Jewishness. The long-term prospects of
      “passing” successfully were not good, but in Anna’s case the will to try was
      all but absent.</p><p>At Auschwitz Anna had the supreme good fortune of being
      assigned to a block run by a Polish political prisoner, probably arrested for
      resistance activity, who knew how to please the SS while helping her charges.
      The woman probably saved Anna’s life. While Anna was in Auschwitz the famous
      Sonderkommando revolt of October 7,1944, occurred. Her vivid recollection of
      the rising is mistaken in several respects. Just one SS man was burned alive,
      and two more were killed in the ensuing struggle, along with 450 prisoners.
      Nor did any of the inmates escape. What is significant is the iconographic quality
      of Anna’s telling of the event. The very fact that Jews had at last turned on
      their tormentors took on dimensions in the minds of the victims that can scarcely
      be imagined today.</p><p>Kaletska was thirty-four years old when she was interviewed
      on the afternoon of September 26,1946, in the rehabilitated synagogue of Wiesbaden,
      Germany. Described by Boder as “a woman of fair complexion with naturally light
      hair,” it is understandable that she could, and for a time did, pass as a Gentile,
      although the idea was not always her own. During the interview she frequently
      fell into episodes of sobbing that obscured parts of her story. Boder observed:
      “These paroxysms were obviously nurtured by depressing memory associations,
      justifiable self-pity before a sympathetic listener, and a sense of ‘guilt’
      at having survived. It might be said that Mrs. Kovitzka feels as if her own
      redemption from the fate which befell her near and dear ones and her concentration
      camp associates was a betrayal of the bonds of love and solidarity.”</p><p class=”footnote”>1.This
      interview appears in Boder’s <em>I Did Not Interview the Dead</em>, under her
      real name, Anna Kovitzka.</p>"

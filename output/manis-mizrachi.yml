        the Consul of Spain has certifies us that we have no reason to be afraid that
        the Germans will take us and but for this obliged us not to leave and not
        to hide ourselves and so the Germans came one night at two o’clock and got
        us [the whole family, they beat us firstly] and afterwards they put us into
        the Greek jail.Mr. Mizrachi’s family spent some eighteen months of relative
        peace and quiet in Athens before the German occupation of that city in September
        1943. Subsequently, Dieter Wisliceny, Adolph Eichmann’s deputy, arrived in
        Athens with detailed plans for the destruction of the Jewish community of
        that city.6

        the time to hide themselves because one day before they arrested all Greek
        citizens, Jews of course.Although the German raids were to prevent Jews going
        into hiding, many Athenian Jews did manage to hide with their Greek Christian
        neighbors despite the German penalty of death  for Greeks providing shelter.
        The Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek underground helped to hide a number
        of Jews.7

        ghetto” in which Jews, mainly from Bohemia and Moravia, Germany and Austria
        were not actually exterminated but died from hunger, torture, disease and
        beatings. Some 88,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt to extermination
        camps in Poland, notably Auschwitz. Towards the end of April 1945, the Germans
        brought thousands of prisoners to Theresienstandt who had been evacuated from
        other concentration camps in danger of being overrun by Allied forces. Mr.
        Mizrarchi and his family could have been among these evacuees had they not
        been liberated from their deportation train.16 In the last days—two days before
        the English came, the British troops came in Bergen-Belsen.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>David Boder conducted this interview with Manis Mizrachi on August 12,
      1946 in Paris at the offices of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
      The interview was conducted in English. Mr. Mizrarchi was born and raised in
      Salonika, Greece, the most prominent Sephardic Jewish religious and cultural
      community in Europe at the time. It numbered some 56,000 Jews on the eve of
      World War II. Mr. Mizrachi was the only child of a fairly well-to-do family.
      His father was a sales representative for several companies importing various
      goods from abroad.</p><p>The Germans conquered Salonika on April 9, 1941, but
      it was not until March 1943 hat the deportations to Auschwitz Birkenau began.
      These were proceeded by humiliation, slave labor for some and systematic expropriation.
      On the eve of the deportations, there was widespread poverty, malnutrition and
      disease in the community. </p><p>Before the German conquest of Greece, however,
      Mr. Mizrachi and his family had fled to Athens, the capital of the country.
      Athens became part of the Italian zone of occupation. The Jews in Athens were
      treated by the Italians in a benevolent manner. Mr. Mizarchi’s family also relied
      for safety on Manis’ fathers Spanish citizenship. Spain, under fascist dictator
      Francisco Franco, remained neutral during World War II. The Germans occupied
      Athens after the fall of Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italian government in September
      1943. In April 1944, those Jews in Athens who held Spanish citizenship were
      deported in a grueling and ghastly journey to Bergen Belsen concentration camp
      in Germany where they were interned in the so-called neutral camp for prisoners
      who were nationals of neutral countries. As English troops were closing in on
      Bergen Belsen in April 1945, Mr. Mizrachi and his family were deported to the
      Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia but were liberated by American soldiers
      from the deportation train. Tragically, Mr. Mizrachi’s  father died of typhus
      on the family’s day of liberation, and his mother died shortly thereafter. Mr.
      Mizrachi also contracted typhus but survived. At  the time of the interview,
      he was studying radio in hopes of emigrating to the United States.</p><p>Mr.
      Mizrachi’s story reveals the suffering and loss experienced  even by those Jews
      who were fortunate to possess citizenship from neutral countries. Though Mr.
      Mizrachi luckily survived, he had experienced great tribulations and was alone
      in the world.</p>"

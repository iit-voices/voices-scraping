        world.1

      end: '00:02:51.008'
      u: Before the Germans came to Greece since my father was a Freemason,The Freemasons
        were a secretive, liberal, humanitarian fraternal order. The Nazis persecuted
        the Freemasons in the belief that Masonic lodges were used by Jews in their
        quest for world domination and as such were a part of the Jewish world conspiracy.4
        we...were afraid for the Germans, them not to take him away from us. That
        for we made it up to go to Athens, the capital of Greece, since it is a very
        big country so we could...

    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:02:55.459'
      end: '00:02:56.220'
      u: Better protected.Some Jews from Salonika did flee to Athens which came under
        Italian control after the German conquest of Greece on June 2, 1941. The Italians
        treated the Jews humanely.5
    - who: David Boder

    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:05.282'
      end: '00:03:07.518'
      u: Turkish? And you were considered what?
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:03:07.518'
      end: '00:03:10.476'
      u: I have been considered Spanish.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:10.476'
      end: '00:03:14.577'
      u: Because your father was Spanish. Have you lived in Spain?
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:03:14.577'
      end: '00:03:16.632'
      u: Never, I have never in Spain.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:16.632'
      end: '00:03:19.780'
      u: Yes, all right, and so you went to Athens
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:03:19.780'
      end: '00:03:51.002'
      u: And so we went to Athens but anyhow the Germans took us because although
        the Consul of Spain has certifies us that we have no reason to be afraid that
        the Germans will take us and but for this obliged us not to leave and not
        to hide ourselves and so the Germans came one night at two o’clock and got
        us [the whole family, they beat us firstly] and afterwards they put us into
        the Greek jail.Mr. Mizrachi’s family spent some eighteen months of relative
        peace and quiet in Athens before the German occupation of that city in September
        1943. Subsequently, Dieter Wisliceny, Adolph Eichmann’s deputy, arrived in
        Athens with detailed plans for the destruction of the Jewish community of
        that city.6
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:51.002'
      end: '00:04:04.271'
      u: 'All right, now...Tell me this...[mutters] All right, tell me this: Were
        other Jews then arrested already and deported?'
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:04:04.271'
      end: '00:04:11.592'
      u: A lot of Jews, Spanish Jews, were arrested and [spread?] with our family
        together.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:11.592'
      end: '00:04:16.175'
      u: Yes, and what was it a kind of a raid at that time or what?
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:04:16.175'
      end: '00:04:29.122'
      u: It was a raid, it was a raid for whole Spanish in order not to leave them
        the time to hide themselves because one day before they arrested all Greek
        citizens, Jews of course.Although the German raids were to prevent Jews going
        into hiding, many Athenian Jews did manage to hide with their Greek Christian
        neighbors despite the German penalty of death  for Greeks providing shelter.
        The Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek underground helped to hide a number
        of Jews.7
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:29.122'
      end: '00:04:39.264'
      u: They arrested the Greeks citizens that were Jews. And now they began to arrest
        the Spanish citizens...well didn’t you show your papers from the Consul?
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:04:39.264'
      end: '00:04:43.817'
      u: We showed our papers from the Consul but it [laughing a little] helped nothing.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:43.817'
      end: '00:04:47.978'
      u: All right, so then what did they do with the family, go slowly step-by-step.
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:04:47.978'
      end: '00:05:04.889'
      u: Then they put us in cars and brought us in the Greek jail where we were obliged
        to sleep down without any help...they give us no things to eat, nothing. We’re
        made whole day without any thing...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:04.889'
      end: '00:05:06.914'
      u: "[interrupting] Was the family together?"
    - who: Manis Mizrachi
      start: '00:05:06.914'
      end: '00:05:34.165'
      u: The family was together firstly; afterwards, they ordered us the men to go
        separately and the women from the other side. So we remained there in the
        jail about fifteen days and the first of April we were obliged to leave the
        jail and they put us into trains...of beasts.The German roundup of the Jews
        of Athens began in March 1944.8
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:34.165'
      end: '00:05:37.364'
      u: Why do you call it “trains of beasts?” They were...

      start: '00:05:37.364'
      end: '00:05:44.595'
      u: Because they were closed trains were they are putting the [laughing a little]...horses
        and...the pigs
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:44.595'

      start: '00:05:49.328'
      end: '00:05:53.911'

      start: '00:05:55.665'
      end: '00:06:15.754'
      u: The wires were at the windows. Little window was there, very high, although
        they were afraid us not to look from what happened around and so they put
        us there and they locked us, the door so we couldn’t get out for any necessary...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:15.754'

        difficult to take air and to eat, we had nothing to eat.
    - who: David Boder

      u: No, it was in a piece of papers what they gave us specially for that.This
        exchange between Boder and Mr. Mizrachi is not entirely clear. Perhaps “pocket”
        meant “bucket” for waste which was then placed in the “piece of paper” and
        thrown out of the train every two days.9

        and the town of Celle which is some kilometers far from the camp, real camp
        of Bergen-Belsen. And so we went there, we were obliged to go—to step seven
        or eight kilometers.Bergen Belsen concentration camp was named for the nearby
        town of Bergen. It was established in July 1943 and was originally intended
        for Jews whom the German government wished to exchange for Germans in Allied
        territory.10

        boiled water. This was our eating. And we gave it to other brothers of us—other
        Jews—of Greece. And Polish people too who were with us in the camp.These were
        Polish Jews who had papers in their possession issued mostly by South American
        countries.13 And we were obliged after one week to eat because we starved.
        And so we carried everything—everything green that we saw on the earth we
        took it out from there and we started to eat it without caring if it was dirty
        or clean.

        Mizrachi was deported to Bergen Belsen in April of 1944, he would have been
        incarcerated there for twelve months, not eighteen months. He and his family
        were deported from the camp in April, 1945 just prior to its liberation by
        the British army.15

      end: '00:14:59.816'
      u: Then I have been taken—we have been put into a big train in order to be transported
        to Theresienstadt.Theresienstadt was the so-called “luxury camp” or “model
        ghetto” in which Jews, mainly from Bohemia and Moravia, Germany and Austria
        were not actually exterminated but died from hunger, torture, disease and
        beatings. Some 88,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt to extermination
        camps in Poland, notably Auschwitz. Towards the end of April 1945, the Germans
        brought thousands of prisoners to Theresienstandt who had been evacuated from
        other concentration camps in danger of being overrun by Allied forces. Mr.
        Mizrarchi and his family could have been among these evacuees had they not
        been liberated from their deportation train.16 In the last days—two days before
        the English came, the British troops came in Bergen-Belsen.

      u: "[In English] This is spool 9-125B. It was split up orginally from Spool
        125 and divided in spool 125A which is Mr. Gutman and 9-125B which is Mr.
        O-S-T-M-A-N. Or, O like in “ocean,” S like in “Sam,” T like in “Tom,” L like
        in “love,” A like in “Adam,” N like in “Nat,” D like in “Denver.” The name
        cannot be clearly detected from the spool. In both cases it seems that the
        name was a ficticious one."

      u: France, September the 13th, 1946, at Hénonville, 50 kilometers from Paris
        in a home maintained by the Agudah, together with the ORT. The principal inhabitants
        is a Khasidic group under the leadership of their rabbi, but they are rendering
        hospitality in a separate wing to a Yeshiva which came over from Lithuania
        together with their rabbi.

      u: "[In Yiddish] How many people are there in this Yeshiva?"

      start: '00:01:35.451'
      end: '00:01:36.097'
      u: Twenty.

      u: But there are more coming.

      u: "[In English] So far there are twenty people...students in this Yeshiva but
        from day to day they expect another group coming in. I am now interviewing
        the rabbi of this group, Rabbi Isaac Ostland who is going to talk to us now.Remark
        of the investigator made at the moment of translation in 1950: I suspect that
        this is an assumed name. The so-called infiltrees, that is the individuals
        who were running away from Lithuania and Poland or other regions which we
        are accustomed now to call the “iron curtain” states were behaving rather
        cautiously. They would not give their right names and not tell too much about
        how they managed to arrive in France, or for that matter in Switzerland or
        Italy.1"

      start: '00:01:55.078'
      end: '00:02:04.562'
      u: "[In Yiddish] And so, Rabbi, will you please tell us again in an orderly
        fashion where you are from, how old you are, and something about your family?"
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:02:04.562'
      end: '00:02:35.417'
      u: I was born 70 kilometers from Vilna, in a small town [called] Labonar, in
        the year 1915. My father was the local rabbi and slaughterer. He sent me to
        study first to the great Yeshiva of Ponevezys with the Ponevezys Rabbi Caneman;
        afterwards in the great Yeshiva of Telsh under Rabbi Bloch whose son-in-law
        I have now become.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:35.417'
      end: '00:02:44.181'
      u: Now, Rabbi, will you please tell me where you were and what happened to you
        when the war started?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:02:44.181'
      end: '00:03:14.741'
      u: When the war started I happened to arrive by accident with a group of Yeshiva
        people from the Yeshiva of Telsh in [the city of] Telsh, because we had to
        abandon the hamlet Shiblovo where the Yeshiva of Telsh was located. We had
        to get out of there on account of significant events, so we arrived in Telsh.
        And from Telsh, on a Sunday, the day when the war started, we escaped to Krishek
        [I am not sure of the exact name]. There we found a second group of the Yeshiva
        of Telsh and from there we departed for Russia.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:14.741'
      end: '00:03:18.306'
      u: Excuse me. Why did people have to go away from there?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:03:18.306'
      end: '00:03:41.576'
      u: There was a Polish Yeshiva in the hamlet Rasein [I am not sure of the name]
        which the Soviets wanted to send away to Siberia. But the members of the Yeshiva
        dispersed into the neighboring hamlets and when they were unable, in gathering
        them together, to distinguish who are the Polish Yeshiva people and who are
        the Lithuanian [Yeshiva people] we stood pat [the expression apparently meant
        that “we would not betray them”] and that is why we had to get away from there.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:41.576'
      end: '00:03:42.400'
      u: Go on.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:03:42.400'
      end: '00:04:10.922'
      u: 'When we arrived in Telsh Sunday morning and hearing that war was declared
        by Hitler - cursed be his name - we all got terribly scared, we did not know
        what to do now. We, the young ones, have decided to run away to Russia but
        my father-in-law, the Rabbi of Telsh, with the other members of the Yeshiva
        remained unfortunately there. My wife too was there and she reports the following:'

      start: '00:04:10.922'
      end: '00:04:13.001'
      u: Were you already married then?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:04:13.001'
      end: '00:04:13.516'
      u: No.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:13.516'
      end: '00:04:15.726'
      u: No.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:04:15.726'
      end: '00:04:28.510'
      u: "[She] tells that on Friday evening all Jews were called together in Telsh
        near the lake [he did not pronounce clearly this word]. The German authorities
        called out..."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:28.510'
      end: '00:04:29.738'
      u: Near what, the river?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:04:29.738'
      end: '00:04:38.720'
      u: ". . . the lake, and they called for somebody from the community who could
        speak German. The rabbi volunteered [declaring] that he speaks German."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:38.720'
      end: '00:04:39.393'
      u: Rabbi Bloch?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:04:39.393'
      end: '00:05:29.970'
      u: Rabbi Bloch. So that the rest should be able to understand what they were
        talking about. Rabbi Bloch bravely stepped forward from the [assembled] congregation
        [one word not clear]. The German representative reproached him that the Jews
        were sniping through the windows at the Germans, and for that reason the Jews
        are being threatened with severe punishment. Rabbi Bloch endeavored strongly
        to prove the meaninglessness of such an accusation; he explained how alien
        such action is to the Jews. There occurred some other incident in the negotiations
        but that was not reported to the community. When Rabbi Bloch returned from
        the negotiations to the congregation there took place a little meeting of
        the heads of the community...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:29.970'
      end: '00:05:30.802'
      u: "[The last two words were given in Hebrew and the interviewer asked for their
        meaning.]"
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:05:30.802'
      end: '00:05:33.467'
      u: That means the representatives [of the Jewish inhabitants] of the city.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:33.467'
      end: '00:05:34.905'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:05:34.905'
      end: '00:06:12.730'
      u: As a result of this meeting Rabbi Bloch presented himself before the community
        and talked to them in very severe terms and demanded from the community penitence.
        He explained that the only means to be saved in such a moment is a miracle.
        [the last two words are in Hebrew, I am not sure of the correct translation].
        There is no natural way [to salvation]. He demanded from the community that
        they mend their ways with reference to three things; to preserve the purity
        of the family life, to observe the Sabbath, and to observe the dietary laws.
        This proposal was accepted by the community, and all like one, the pious and
        the free [thinkers], children and old ones, men and women, have resolved immediately
        to go through with it.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:12.730'
      end: '00:06:14.334'
      u: Which three things [the interviewer did not understand clearly the three
        Hebrew terms]?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:06:14.334'
      end: '00:06:18.077'
      u: The Sabbath, the dietary laws, and pure family life.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:18.077'
      end: '00:06:19.336'
      u: "[The interviewer understood now the first two terms but inquired about the
        third one]."
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:06:19.336'
      end: '00:06:22.505'
      u: "[Translating] pure family life."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:22.505'
      end: '00:06:26.346'
      u: Yes. Now continue.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:06:26.346'
      end: '00:07:09.866'
      u: And then for no reason known to us there was all at once deferred the terrible
        sentence over the Jewish community of Telsh, which they had doomed to be exterminated;
        but the Germans permitted the women to go home immediately, while the men
        had to remain there overnight and afterwards they were led to a lager [camp]
        and for the time being nothing was done to them. The morning after they also
        called together the women and led them away to a different lager. The first
        lager, the one for the men, was located 4 kilometers from the city of Telsh.
        It was called Gerul, and the second lager was called Raim [the name is not
        clear].
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:09.866'
      end: '00:07:11.046'
      u: What were these lagers, back yards?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:07:11.046'
      end: '00:07:52.177'
      u: A kind of a farm. There they held the men for two weeks and during this time
        the three vows which they have pledged were not complied with and their doom
        was sealed [I am not sure of the correct translation of the last two worlds
        given in Hebrew]. In two weeks, it was on that gruesome day of Tammuz [a midsummer
        month of the Jewish calendar, usually the hottest month of the mid-European
        summer] the men were assembled one evening, and they were submitted to horrible,
        horrible torture. They cut off their beards and they forced the older people
        to dance the “devils dance,” they called it, and tortured and tormented them
        to the brink of death.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:52.177'
      end: '00:07:53.238'
      u: Who did this?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:07:53.238'
      end: '00:07:55.884'
      u: The Germans with the Lithuanian partisans.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:55.884'
      end: '00:07:57.856'
      u: Ah, the Germans together with the Lithuanian partisans.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:07:57.856'
      end: '00:07:58.926'
      u: With the Lithuanian partisans.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:58.926'
      end: '00:08:01.393'
      u: Go on.
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:08:01.393'
      end: '00:08:08.890'
      u: They were informed that that was their last day, that they have time to live
        until next morning. The next morning...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:08.890'
      end: '00:08:10.229'
      u: Who told you that?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:08:10.229'
      end: '00:08:15.785'
      u: "[as if continuing the sentence]...that was done by those terrible criminals
        who were standing around there, the Germans and the Lithuanians together."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:15.785'
      end: '00:08:17.124'
      u: But who told you all that?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:08:17.124'
      end: '00:08:19.528'
      u: My wife, the daughter of Rabbi Bloch, Khaje.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:19.528'
      end: '00:08:22.807'
      u: And how did she know about it, she wasn’t with the men?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:08:22.807'
      end: '00:08:29.975'
      u: Yes...the children. She as a child of Rabbi Bloch...the children were then
        still with the men.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:29.975'
      end: '00:08:32.253'
      u: So. And the women were kept separate?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:08:32.253'
      end: '00:09:08.469'
      u: The women were kept separately. They were made to get up at five o’clock
        in the morning under the pretext that they are being taken to work, but it
        was already known what kind of work expected them. Crowded by murderers they
        were led out about 200 meters from the lager and there began the terrible
        shootings at which my wife was already not present but the screams and the
        outcries of the shooting were heard in the lager where she was.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:08.469'
      end: '00:09:09.887'

      end: '00:09:10.849'
      u: All men.

      u: And they left the children?
    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:09:11.661'
      end: '00:09:57.228'
      u: 'They left the children but the men were shot near the ditch [common grave].
        And one of these people who saved himself from among the men told later how
        from the ditch where Rabbi Bloch was lying, one heard the cry, “Sma Ysreil”
        [Hear, O Israel], because it was before daybreak, the time for Krishma [a
        special prayer for that hour], so he still recited the Krishma and his soul
        departed on the word Aekhod [the full sentence of the prayer reads: “Hear,
        O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one”]. The same thing happened the
        next day, caph aleph [the 21st]. That part of the men whom they had not managed
        to shoot caph Tammuz [Footnote: The tenth month of the Jewish calendar.] [the
        20th of Tammuz] they shot on caph aleph Tammuz [the 21st]. The women who were
        in the second lager, that is 16 kilometers from Telsh...'

        separately?

      end: '00:10:03.676'

      start: '00:10:03.676'
      end: '00:10:06.817'
      u: But from the start? [He talks at the same time as the interviewer and one
        cannot clearly understand what he is saying. The interviewees are often irritated
        by questions and do not permit the interviewer to finish the question but
        just talk simultaneously with him.] So at the start the children were with
        the men and the women were alone?
    - who: Isaac Ostland

      end: '00:10:08.136'

      end: '00:11:20.535'
      u: After a certain time has elapsed they came to the lager of the women and
        counted them up. The older ones and the very young ones they separated on
        one side and the young ones, that is the ones able to work...it became obvious
        immediately that those who are able to work have been granted a little bit
        more time to live and that those unfit for work are already doomed. My wife
        managed to extract her mother from among the unable to work into the group
        of able to work. And for that reason her mother with her other sisters returned
        to Telsh where there was created a ghetto which existed for a few months longer.
        During this time some of the younger ones and energetic ones managed to slip
        out of the ghetto, to hide among the Christians. They managed to live through
        the several years of war with them and those who remained alive are already
        by now...some of them in the land of Israel and some of them are in Poland.

    - who: Isaac Ostland
      start: '00:11:23.715'
      end: '00:11:42.115'
      u: With Jewish papers, because there could be found...although very few Christian
        families who were able to appraise the significance of saving a Jewish life.
        There were some who saved them with the purpose to convert to Christianity
        the children, and they did so later on...

      u: ". . . and that is the purpose why they saved them...but later of course,
        when the war was over the children were returned to the Jewish faith and remained
        pure and fine Jews."

        And in general not being accustomed to physical work away from the [books
        of] Talmud, it was very hard for us. We lost a lot of strength. And we remained
        there until Sukkoth [the autumn Feast of the Tabernacles], observing all the
        Jewish traditions, dietary laws, and observance of the Sabbath. But in time
        we began to suffer, we had to get away from there because our physical strength
        did not permit us to remain at such hard labor.

        Prophets and Writings. And there were some among us who knew [the scripture]
        by heart, so we held every Saturday conferences reciting the words of the
        Bible or the scriptures which we knew by heart.

        When we arrived there—the messages which we sent to our group as we learned
        later were not received by them, they could not receive any word from us,

        three comrades. These were Chaim Stein, Meyer Karonovitz, Meyer Zeligman.
        Then we also received the sad information about the other ten persons who
        were not alive any more. The reports were as follows: passing near Bukhara—there

        means “admonition.” There are two “Takhakhos” in the Pentateuch, one in Leviticus
        XXVI: 14-46, and the other in Deuteronomy XXVIII: 15-26. Both “Takhakhos”
        contain the maledictions and threats of most unspeakable suffering which were
        to come over the Children of Israel if they should “not hearken unto the voice
        of the Lord...to observe to do all His commandments.” An analysis of the cardinal
        difference between the two “Takhakhos” is given in Footnote 7.]"

      u: 'Yes, we are now in Elul, and this Saturday also “Section Bechuckotay”[Footnote:
        In spite of the spontaneous correction which he made a few sentences before,
        Rabbi Ostland commits again the same slip of the tongue (of apparently Freudian
        nature), giving “Bechuckotay” instead of “Ki Tahbo.” Could it be that for
        him personally the highpoint of German violence came with the deportation
        so vividly described in “Bechuckotay,” It suffices to quote only one verse
        from “Takhakho Bechuckotay” which expresses by no means the most extreme of
        the depredations that were to come over the Children of Israel if they should
        fail to observe the teachings of the Torah: “And I will bring a sword upon
        you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered
        together within your cities; and I will send the Pestilence among you; and
        ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.” (Leviticus XXVI: 25) In
        general “Takhakho Ki Tahbo” lists the “mortal sins” while “Takhakho Bechuckotay”
        gives the most detailed aspects of punishment by catastrophe. Both the tendency
        to suppress even the thought of such sings referring in large measure to sex
        perversions on the one hand, while on the other hand the memories of the German
        inhumanities did not cease to haunt them, may also account for this repeated
        substitution of “Bechuckotay” for “Ki Tahbo.” No wonder that Rabbi Ostland,
        as well as his father-in-law, Rabbi Bloch, as so many pious Jews, were struck
        by the vivid resemblance between the castastrophe brought upon them by the
        Germans who evoked into reality above any measure, most of the macabre prophecies
        of the “Takhakho Bechuckotay.”] is being read.'

      u: Yes. So in the middle of the services all Jews were taken from the house
        of prayer as they were in midst of the recitation of the Torah, and everything
        was left; the Bibles open, even the Torah with the point at its side [a small
        stick to point at the lines and words during reading], and the house of prayer
        was sealed and the Jews led away. They put a seal on the door of the house
        of prayer. And things remained that way until the day when Vilna was again
        liberated...

        through in several places and there were dug for military purposes trenches

        or if it refers to the first saint] and other very famous men. And to find

      u: And in general it was destroyed and excavated. And in spite of all the efforts
        to establish order in Vilna, all our labors brought very little results. Like
        in those times there still take place maneuvers, military maneuvers and the
        destruction continues [I am not sure of the last few words]. Now about the
        other things. When afterwards the congregation began to grow in Vilna when
        the number of Jews increased, it became too crowded in number 19 German Street
        and it was decided to move to Zavalnya Street 35 to the Choral Synagogue.
        There we found two rooms adjoining the Choral Synagogue. There we established
        the congregation and after Rabbi Gutman left the town when he departed for
        Poland, we took over the rabbinate; also the shohets changed [in membership
        and personnel]. The parish developed rather well. It devoted itself to social
        service and it distributed during the course of the one summer ’45- [the congregation]
        distributed up to 100,000 rubles for the poor, for those who returned from
        lagers, for strangers who arrived. The parish also devoted itself with the
        reestablishment of Jewish life [I am not sure of the translation]. They established
        a wide correspondence for the communication from friend to friend and other
        important work. At the end of ’45 there were in Vilna already nearly 17,000
        Jews. But unfortunately, there was no need in Vilna for more than one single
        house of prayer. There could be no more than one single assembly for prayer
        in the whole city of Vilna.

      u: She came...she came from Germany and I being in Vilna, hearing that the daughter
        of my teacher was saved...so I sent immediately [a letter?] and brought her
        over to Vilna and kept her with me until the day of departure.

        to tell? [At this instant Ostland apparently insisted that no record be taken.
        He finally agreed to make some additional statements, provided his name is
        not disclosed. Apprehension is obvious from the content of the subsequent
        remarks. Many DPs were reluctant to make anti-Russian statements, fearing
        a remote possibility of being handed over to Soviet authorities. On the other
        hand, the Baltic Christian DPs took, at least on most cases, a solid anti-Soviet
        stand and were reluctant to voice any criticism of the Nazis.]

        to Poland, partly with the purpose to go to the Land of Israel, partly just
        to save themselves. [He constantly lowers his voice as if imparting dangerous

        were detained en route. The story as it was transmitted to us was like this:
        four automobiles with people who intended to “steal” the border, departed
        from Vilna. They were halted en route, fire was opened against the automobiles,
        the automobiles refused to stop. As a consequence of this shooting one person
        was killed instantly while sitting in the car, ten were wounded and all were

        population in Lithuania which could not understand the meaning of such action
        of the Soviet government against the people who wanted to leave the country

        125 and divided in spool 125A which is Mr. Gutman and 9-125B which is Mr.
        O-S-T-M-A-N. Or, O like in “ocean,” S like in “Sam,” T like in “Tom,” L like
        in “love,” A like in “Adam,” N like in “Nat,” D like in “Denver.” The name
        cannot be clearly detected from the spool. In both cases it seems that the
        name was a ficticious one."

        in a home maintained by the Agudah, together with the ORT. The principal inhabitants
        is a Khasidic group under the leadership of their rabbi, but they are rendering
        hospitality in a separate wing to a Yeshiva which came over from Lithuania
        together with their rabbi.

        from day to day they expect another group coming in. I am now interviewing
        the rabbi of this group, Rabbi Isaac Ostland who is going to talk to us now.Remark
        of the investigator made at the moment of translation in 1950: I suspect that
        this is an assumed name. The so-called infiltrees, that is the individuals
        who were running away from Lithuania and Poland or other regions which we
        are accustomed now to call the “iron curtain” states were behaving rather
        cautiously. They would not give their right names and not tell too much about
        how they managed to arrive in France, or for that matter in Switzerland or
        Italy.1"

      u: I was born 70 kilometers from Vilna, in a small town [called] Labonar, in
        the year 1915. My father was the local rabbi and slaughterer. He sent me to
        study first to the great Yeshiva of Ponevezys with the Ponevezys Rabbi Caneman;
        afterwards in the great Yeshiva of Telsh under Rabbi Bloch whose son-in-law
        I have now become.

      u: When the war started I happened to arrive by accident with a group of Yeshiva
        people from the Yeshiva of Telsh in [the city of] Telsh, because we had to
        abandon the hamlet Shiblovo where the Yeshiva of Telsh was located. We had
        to get out of there on account of significant events, so we arrived in Telsh.
        And from Telsh, on a Sunday, the day when the war started, we escaped to Krishek
        [I am not sure of the exact name]. There we found a second group of the Yeshiva
        of Telsh and from there we departed for Russia.

      u: There was a Polish Yeshiva in the hamlet Rasein [I am not sure of the name]
        which the Soviets wanted to send away to Siberia. But the members of the Yeshiva
        dispersed into the neighboring hamlets and when they were unable, in gathering
        them together, to distinguish who are the Polish Yeshiva people and who are
        the Lithuanian [Yeshiva people] we stood pat [the expression apparently meant
        that “we would not betray them”] and that is why we had to get away from there.

        what to do now. We, the young ones, have decided to run away to Russia but
        my father-in-law, the Rabbi of Telsh, with the other members of the Yeshiva

        talking about. Rabbi Bloch bravely stepped forward from the [assembled] congregation
        [one word not clear]. The German representative reproached him that the Jews
        were sniping through the windows at the Germans, and for that reason the Jews
        are being threatened with severe punishment. Rabbi Bloch endeavored strongly
        to prove the meaninglessness of such an accusation; he explained how alien
        such action is to the Jews. There occurred some other incident in the negotiations
        but that was not reported to the community. When Rabbi Bloch returned from
        the negotiations to the congregation there took place a little meeting of
        the heads of the community...

        and talked to them in very severe terms and demanded from the community penitence.
        He explained that the only means to be saved in such a moment is a miracle.
        [the last two words are in Hebrew, I am not sure of the correct translation].
        There is no natural way [to salvation]. He demanded from the community that
        they mend their ways with reference to three things; to preserve the purity
        of the family life, to observe the Sabbath, and to observe the dietary laws.
        This proposal was accepted by the community, and all like one, the pious and
        the free [thinkers], children and old ones, men and women, have resolved immediately
        to go through with it.

        had to remain there overnight and afterwards they were led to a lager [camp]
        and for the time being nothing was done to them. The morning after they also
        called together the women and led them away to a different lager. The first
        lager, the one for the men, was located 4 kilometers from the city of Telsh.
        It was called Gerul, and the second lager was called Raim [the name is not

        month of the Jewish calendar, usually the hottest month of the mid-European
        summer] the men were assembled one evening, and they were submitted to horrible,
        horrible torture. They cut off their beards and they forced the older people
        to dance the “devils dance,” they called it, and tortured and tormented them
        to the brink of death.

        In spite of the spontaneous correction which he made a few sentences before,
        Rabbi Ostland commits again the same slip of the tongue (of apparently Freudian
        nature), giving “Bechuckotay” instead of “Ki Tahbo.” Could it be that for
        him personally the highpoint of German violence came with the deportation
        so vividly described in “Bechuckotay,” It suffices to quote only one verse
        from “Takhakho Bechuckotay” which expresses by no means the most extreme of
        the depredations that were to come over the Children of Israel if they should
        fail to observe the teachings of the Torah: “And I will bring a sword upon
        you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered
        together within your cities; and I will send the Pestilence among you; and
        ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.” (Leviticus XXVI: 25) In
        general “Takhakho Ki Tahbo” lists the “mortal sins” while “Takhakho Bechuckotay”
        gives the most detailed aspects of punishment by catastrophe. Both the tendency
        to suppress even the thought of such sings referring in large measure to sex
        perversions on the one hand, while on the other hand the memories of the German
        inhumanities did not cease to haunt them, may also account for this repeated
        substitution of “Bechuckotay” for “Ki Tahbo.” No wonder that Rabbi Ostland,
        as well as his father-in-law, Rabbi Bloch, as so many pious Jews, were struck
        by the vivid resemblance between the castastrophe brought upon them by the
        Germans who evoked into reality above any measure, most of the macabre prophecies
        of the “Takhakho Bechuckotay.”] is being read.'

        was sealed and the Jews led away. They put a seal on the door of the house

        was the old cemetery, [the next few words are not clear] the one that had
        the new fence, which was erected not long ago. This one [the fence] was broken
        through in several places and there were dug for military purposes trenches
        and it was desecrated very badly. On the day when we arrived we visited the
        cemetery, and our hearts ached.'

        I cannot establish whether he mentions the name of another venerated person
        or if it refers to the first saint] and other very famous men. And to find
        it in such a horrible state. All our efforts to fence it in again, and to
        throw out all the extraneous rubble which the former armies left there were
        for the time being, in vain, and the cemetery still remained in a terrible,
        regretable state.

        to establish order in Vilna, all our labors brought very little results. Like
        in those times there still take place maneuvers, military maneuvers and the
        destruction continues [I am not sure of the last few words]. Now about the
        other things. When afterwards the congregation began to grow in Vilna when
        the number of Jews increased, it became too crowded in number 19 German Street
        and it was decided to move to Zavalnya Street 35 to the Choral Synagogue.
        There we found two rooms adjoining the Choral Synagogue. There we established
        the congregation and after Rabbi Gutman left the town when he departed for
        Poland, we took over the rabbinate; also the shohets changed [in membership
        and personnel]. The parish developed rather well. It devoted itself to social
        service and it distributed during the course of the one summer ’45- [the congregation]
        distributed up to 100,000 rubles for the poor, for those who returned from
        lagers, for strangers who arrived. The parish also devoted itself with the
        reestablishment of Jewish life [I am not sure of the translation]. They established
        a wide correspondence for the communication from friend to friend and other
        important work. At the end of ’45 there were in Vilna already nearly 17,000
        Jews. But unfortunately, there was no need in Vilna for more than one single
        house of prayer. There could be no more than one single assembly for prayer
        in the whole city of Vilna.

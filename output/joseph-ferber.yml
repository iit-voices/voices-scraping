      u: I was born in Brody,Brody (Yid. Brod) was in the Tarnopol district of Poland
        (then southeastern Poland, now northwestern Ukraine). The town was a center
        of nineteenth century Jewish progressive thinking and had a strong Zionist
        movement. In September, 1939, the Soviets occupied the city, but the Germans
        took over shortly after the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union
        on June, 22, 1941. During the German occupation, the Jews of Brody were terrorized,
        persecuted, ghettoized and then murdered. Only about 250 of the 9,000 Jews
        in Brody on the eve of World War II survived.1 on the former Austro-Russian
        border. Later the town belonged to Poland. There I went to school, gymnasium
        [middle-level schools] and then I went to Cracow, where I was working until
        the year 1939.Located in southern Poland, the historic city was for several
        centuries the capital of the early Polish kingdom. Jewish settlement in Kraków
        dates from at least the early fourteenth century. During the German occupation,
        the city became the seat of the Nazi General Government run by the notorious
        Hans Frank.2

      u: When the German-Polish war began I returned to Brody. There I...the Soviets
        had come there on the seventeenth of September, 1939. Under them I also worked
        as a teller in a bank, as inspector, and then also as a bookkeeper.Mr. Ferber
        is referring to the outbreak of World War II which began with the German invasion
        of Poland on September 1, 1939. Two days later France and Great Britain declared
        war on Germany.3

      u: And so tell me, Mr. Ferber, how did that suddenly change from the Polish
        government to the Soviet? Did they immediately install in your place the whole
        Soviet regime?

      u: No. Following the escape in September, during the war, of the Polish government
        to Rumania, the Soviet government declared that all political and diplomatic
        relations between them are terminated. On the 17th of September the Red Army
        received an order to march into West Ukraine and West White Russia in order
        to liberate the people who were living there as a part of the people of Great
        Ukraine and of White Russia. After the Soviets were there a month they made
        a plebiscite, elections. The elections took place in all cities, towns, and
        villages. Then in Lemberg, during the assembly of all the elected deputies,
        it was decided to turn to the highest council of Soviet Russia with the request
        that these countries should be recognized as a part of Soviet Russia. And
        by this procedure these countries were accepted into the Soviet Union, and
        they became recognized as part of the country. [Pause.]In fact, the Soviet
        Union occupied eastern Poland in accordance with a secret protocol in the
        Nazi Soviet pact signed on August 23, 1939 between the foreign ministers of
        the two totalitarian powers. The protocol called for the division of Poland
        between them by force of arms.4

      u: Well, [the conditions] there were quite good. One cannot say that it was
        not good. Social justice was established. Everybody had to work. Large private
        fortunes, factories, and large estates became nationalized; that means were
        transferred as property of the state. Everybody had to go to work. Everyone
        had a right to work, everyone had a right to an education. The Jews had every
        right, not like it was before under the Polish government where Jewish students
        in the universities used to be beaten with sticks and pummeled, where there
        were many victims. Now everyone had equal rights and equal chances for a life.
        Treatment of the Jewish population under Soviet rule was certainly better
        than under the German occupation. However, in the part of Poland under their
        control, the Soviets nationalized large Jewish businesses and factories, confiscated
        and collectivized land, ended any semblance of Jewish political and social
        autonomy, and deported the “hostile class element” to Siberia. These policies
        impacted the general population as well.5

      u: The majority of such rabid Poles who had been planted there by the Polish
        government that they should polonize the land were taken out deep into Russia.
        And the rest had to sit quietly. They waited until the war started on June
        22, 1941.Eastern Poland during the interwar period was home to many Ukrainians
        as well as Jews. This accounted for the efforts of the Polish government to
        “polonize” the area.6

      u: At that time, on the first day, I was drafted into the Red Army. At that
        time, one can say, emerged anew all those Polish anti-Soviet elements which,
        in the first days of the war, carried out sabotage, who had shot [sniped]
        from the windows and from the roofs at the...at our...at the Red army, so
        that there was a great chaos and the Red Army had to retreat. Retreated far,
        until, until Stalingrad. I, too, went with the Red army as far as Stalingrad,
        and there I have been during the whole time . During all that time I took
        part in the heavy battles, for which I also received a medal, for the defense
        of Stalingrad.The Soviets drafted a number of Jews from Brody into the Red
        army. In total, about half a million Jews served in the Red army during World
        War II, and approximately 200,000 fell in battle. Some 160,000, including
        Mr. Ferber, were awarded medals for bravery. The German invasion of the Soviet
        Union came as a great shock to Stalin, who believed that Hitler would honor
        the August 1939 non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries. News
        of German atrocities against Jews in their zone of occupation from 1939-1941
        was deliberately withheld from Soviet Jewry who were unprepared for the Nazi
        onslaught, as was the Red army which was overwhelmed in the early phase of
        the brutal war. The battle of Stalingrad, lasting from late summer 1942 until
        the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the
        war on the eastern front.7

      u: I was in the Red army close to four and a half years, since the first day
        of the war until at this time a year ago when I was released as a former Polish
        citizen. I was discharged and I went back to Cracow, but before that I had
        gone through with the Red army, taking part in the offensive. From Stalingrad,
        we went through all Russia, the Ukraine, and together with the Second Ukrainian
        front of Marshal Ross... Rokossovsky, no...pardon, Malinovski, I came to...we
        went through Hungary, through Rumania, through Czechoslavakia and finally
        Austria. There, on the 9th of May, 1945, we finished the war.

        World War II ally. During the Romanian occupation, the Jews of Chernevtsky
        were persecuted and ghettoized, and their population was decimated.9

      u: From Siberia...and from whole Russia. All those who were...who had escaped
        during the war to Soviet Russia and were in the defense deep in the country,
        all those have remained alive. In contrast, when we were advancing with the
        offensive, in all the countries, in all the towns where we had passed, where
        once had lived Jewish masses, we found nobody, only destruction and graves.
        Often, not even graves, because the majority of the Jews, nearly all without
        exceptions, also my whole family, all had been taken away either to Belzec,
        or to Treblinka, or to Auschwitz and to other lagers, where they were burned
        in the crematories. So that returning home — I was in my native town — I did
        not find anybody.About 165,000 Polish Jews were repatriated under the Polish/Soviet
        repatriation agreement of July 1945. Some 20,000 went back to Poland under
        a subsequent agreement. About seven percent of the prewar Polish Jewish population
        was saved within the Soviet Union. Belzec and Treblinka were Nazi extermination
        camps designed to annihilate the Jews of the General Government. Auschwitz
        was the largest of the extermination camps and also a concentration camp.
        It had some forty subcamps. Like Mr. Ferber, many survivors experienced the
        loss of their entire families. 10

        hundred. During the 1930’s, there were a number of anti-Semitic incidents

        fights against them, but it is too weak to control these wild beasts. General
        Anders headed an army of Polish exiles formed in the Soviet Union following
        the Nazi invasion. Eventually this army made its way out of the Soviet Union
        via Iran and fought with the Allies against the Germans. After the fall of

        the duration of the war. This government did not have the welfare of Polish
        Jewry as its highest priority. Nevertheless, it transmitted funds contributed
        by Jewish organizations to Polish Jewry, and its public pronouncements eventually

        the interwar period, he became the head of the Palestinian Arabs. The mufti
        had an uncompromisingly negative attitude towards Jewish settlement in Palestine
        and agreed with Nazi ideological goals aimed at the destruction of “world
        Jewry.” During World War II, he pursued Arab national political goals and
        gave active support to the Nazi genocide against European Jewry.17'

        Because a people is immortal. Individual persons may die. Haman, too, as well
        as Hitler have disappeared. Even Churchill had...had to step aside, and we
        hope that Attlee and Bevin, too, will step aside, and England will have to
        recognize our right, as the whole world has to recognize our right, to Eretz
        Yisroeil. Soon after the end of the Second World War, Churchill’s Conservative
        party was defeated in general elections and was succeeded by Clement Atlee’s
        Labour party. At the time, Great Britain continued to control Palestine and
        enforce the terms of its May 1939 White Paper which greatly restricted Jewish
        emigration. Ernest Bevin was Foreign Secretary in the Labour government. He
        pursued an oppressive policy towards the Palestinian Jewish community and
        deported would-be Jewish immigrants to detention camps in Cyprus. After his
        proposals for the solution of the conflict between Arabs and Jews failed,
        he referred the entire matter to the United Nations. In January, 1949, eight
        months after the proclamation of the State of Israel, he granted it Britain’s
        de facto recognition.18

        would hide the children under the beds, under [in] cupboards, on roofs [attics],
        in cellars. Many children remained alive for the reason that they had escaped
        to the forests and fields, and there they hid. Many children did not admit
        to being Jewish children. They had that much intelligence, and they were admitted
        by the Poles into various children’s homes and monastaries [also convents/.
        There they were brought up.More than 6,000 Poles have been honored with the
        award, Righteous Among the Nations, for their efforts in rescuing Jews during
        the Holocaust by Yad Vashem, Israel’s official Holocaust memorial and museum.

        It did not want to say that it has Jewish parents, so they would think that
        perhaps it is a Christian child. For the most part, little girls hid in this
        way. The boys, there were even such who were partisans. Besides that, we have
        such children who had been carried out from the burning ghetto during the
        uprising in Warsaw. They had been carried out and carried out to the Christian
        side, to the Aryan side, and there they would hide out. Only a few days before
        we left Zakopane we found out by accident that these children...there were
        five such Jewish children who were in Zakopane in a Polish children’s home.

        to work in the Aliyah, that means, in the immigration of the Jews to Eretz
        Yisroeil, and they have perhaps various other tasks which are not too well
        known to us.Palestinian Jewry worked throughout Europe in Aliyah Bet, the
        dedicated effort to bring European Jewish Holocaust survivors to Palestine
        in spite of British immigration restrictions. Thus it may defined as “illegal”
        immigration. France became a key center for directing these immigration operations,
        which became a unifying force in the Jewish world and came to enjoy widespread

        there. But every man is drawn to the place where he was born. This is simply
        such a sentiment. And besides that, this has to be taken into account. Every
        man...I had many friends from Cracow who returned, because they owned homes
        there, they had large possessions. And occasionally they also succeed in getting
        it back, but on the other side, it sometimes leads again to [becoming] victims,
        for the reason that the Poles, seeing a Jew returning who says,’This was my
        house. This was my dwelling. These are my possessions’...so they go and kill
        such a Jew because they do not want to return his possessions which they had
        grabbed at the time when the Germans were there.In fact, especially by the
        late 1930’s, anti-Semitic attitudes had become widespread among the Soviet
        elite and were held by many in the general population. Throughout the war,
        the Jews were not recognized as special victims of Nazi genocide, and this
        concealment continued after the war. From 1948 to 1953, the Black Years of
        Soviet Jewry, anti-Semitism became one of the chief policies of the Stalinist
        regime. 23

        it not be sensible to remain there and to combat the anti-Semitism, and to
        settle there and build there Jewish communities until the situation in Palestine

      u: Something else is to be considered here. On the ruins which we find we do
        not want to build any more. When we come and find a burned home, a destroyed
        workshop, seeing that we have lost everything, everything that was dear was
        killed, we do not want to build any more on these ruins. And because of that
        the Jew thinks, if to start building, it is better to build in his own homeland,
        in one’s own land. This is one [reason]. And the second — it is the unceasing
        danger which threatens. This is the peril to one’s life. Because in Poland,
        as I have said before, exists a strong reactionary force which is committing
        murder and acts of death on every Jew that they chase in the street or even
        in his own home. An example of this is the pogrom which took place at this
        time a year ago in Cracow and a month ago in Kielce,The Polish perpetrators
        of the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946 massacred forty-two Jews in the town
        of Kielce in southeastern Poland and wounded fifty more. The pogrom was sparked
        by a rumor that Jews were killing Polish children and drinking their blood.
        This event sparked a mass exodus of tens of thousands of Jews from Poland
        and other countries of eastern Europe who despaired of rebuilding productive
        and secure lives there.24 where from the Shaarith Hapleta [that is, from a
        few hundred remaining Jews] ...She’erit ha-Peletah (“surviving remnant”) is
        a term taken from First Chronicles 4:43. This was the Hebrew name given to
        the organization of Holocaust survivors, most in displaced persons’ camps,
        following the war. The organization’s primary goals were emigration of Jews
        from Europe primarily to settle in Palestine. It existed from 1945 until December,
        1950 when its Central Committee ceased to exist.25

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Joseph Ferber was born in the town of Brody, then in eastern Poland.
      After completing his schooling, he went to the city of Kraków where he worked
      as bookkeeper. When World War II began, he returned to Brody, which fell under
      Soviet rule in accordance with the terms of Nazi Soviet Pact. Following the
      German invasion of the Soviet Union, Mr. Ferber was drafted into the Red army,
      in which he served bravely for four years. He fought in a number of battles,
      including the heroic defense of Stalingrad.</p><p>Following his demobilization,
      Mr. Ferber returned to Brody, but found the town destroyed and no trace of his
      family. He then went to the town of Zakopane where he served as the chief security
      officer for a home of Jewish orphans who had been rescued during the war by
      sympathetic Christians. With the help of Jewish refugee relief organizations,
      Mr. Ferber, the children and the orphanage staff made their way to Paris from
      where they hoped to emigrate to Palestine, a desire shared by many survivors
      at the time who saw their future in an independent Jewish homeland. Mr. Ferber’s
      interview reflects his strongly held socialist and Zionist viewpoints.</p>"

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Short interviews with orphan charges at the Bellevue home for displaced
      Jewish orphans funded by French and American Jewish charities (run by Lena Kuechler,
      another Boder interviewee) grant us something like a child’s eye view of the
      Holocaust.</p><p>The interview with thirteen-year-old Raisel Meltzak is understandably
      fragmentary. Boder disagreed with the judgment of supervisory personnel at the
      home that she was somewhat mentally retarded, believing rather that she was
      deeply disturbed. He cut the interview short, possibly to save her from further
      stress, and did not take it up again. Her parents, natives of southeastern Poland,
      an area of mixed Polish and Ukrainian population, hid their family from the
      Germans in a bunker, and then in the forests, alternately helped and looted
      by the local Ukrainians. Her father allowed himself to be persuaded by Jews
      from his own community that it was safest to return to the ghetto, whereas her
      mother insisted on chancing fugitive survival for herself and her two children.
      Raisel was spared having to go into the details of her mother’s death. Judging
      from the fact that the child spoke better Polish than Yiddish, she may have
      come through the Holocaust by being taken in by Polish peasants.</p>\n"

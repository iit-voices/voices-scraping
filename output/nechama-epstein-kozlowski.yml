        This is Mrs. Nechamah Epstein, 23 [years old], a nice looking..a neat looking
        woman already in the sixth or so month of pregnancy—very cheerful, very proud
        of it. And she lives here with her husband in a co-operative camp, a co-operative
        group, in a castle near Como which is being maintained by the Hachshara under
        the auspices of the American Joint Distribution Committee and, apparently,
        UNRRA."

        died. He died. I was there for a time in the Ghetto, and I lived through another
        deportation. There was a large synagogue. There all the Jews were assembled.
        In the synagogue it was terrible. They simply came in...if they heard a cry,
        they shot in. The threw grenades. They beat. They truck. They did not give
        anything to drink. We had to relieve ourselves on the same place where we
        slept. I was there a whole night. I saw it was bad. I did not want to go to
        death. I went on fighting against it. I went over to a window. It was on the
        first floor. We took two towels, I and another girl. We lowered the towels
        from the windows, and we crawled down and escaped down into a cellar, and
        there we again lived through the second [other] deportation.

        in a block. In the middle of the night they were all called together and led
        into the cermatory. They were very heroic. They broke the windows. They would
        not let themselves be burned. But, alas, it was of no avail. The SS were stronger
        than they. Some threw themselves on [attacked] the SS men. For that they were

        The Russians were approaching Krasnik, so they liquidated the lager. And that
        child’s mother had escaped, and she was shot. And that child had come alone,
        without a mother, to the lager. And many children...they were all without
        mothers, because the mothers were immediately taken away. And the children
        separately. And the children were...they did not have enough time to take
        along the mothers. They grabbed the children and ran with them. And the children
        were brought to Plaszow. I took that little girl. I was with that little girl
        for four months. That child was very dear to me. I loved it very much. That
        child could not go anyplace without me. I was thinking I shall live through
        this war. I will be very happy with such a pretty and smart little girl, because
        it had hurt me very much that I had lost my brother’s children. And I cheered
        myself up a little with that child.

        lying on the ground and went over to some man who worked there in the shower-bath,

        morning you will all be undressed nude, and you will all be led before the

        the child will come out. And in the evening I saw the child all dressed up.

        We arrived in Theresienstadt. There were only Jews, many Jews from Germany.
        There were very many old women who were...mixed [intermarried], Germans and
        Jews. They had Jewish sons, SS men...not Jewish sons’ SS men, but their sons
        were SS men. They were serving Hitler, and she...she was Jewish; the husband
        was a German. And that is the reason they remained alive. All old, grey women.
        And all the children with mothers had been transported to Auschwitz before,
        yet. And they were permitted to survive the war. Finally we arrived there.
        Short and sharp [to the point], we were there two months, eight weeks. We
        didn’t received [anything] to eat. It was very little food. And the Germans
        prepared a large crematory. They had heard that the front is again approaching.
        They prepared a large crematory, but they did not have enough time to do it.
        One nice day they called together all the Jews, and they wanted to make an
        air-raid alarm so that we go down into that bunker. There came a German and
        betrayed [divulged] all that. He said that if he will be escorted to Switzerland,
        [then] this will not be carried out. He was promised [that]. The Swiss Red
        Cross took us over, and all of us were saved.

        two, three, days after the liberation, there had fallen very many people.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Boder interviewed a number of survivors from the major Polish cities
      of Lódz and Warsaw. In both, the Jews were placed in large, closed ghettos in
      1940. Nechama Epstein-Kozlowski of Warsaw was perhaps the most cheerful and
      open of the survivors. Evidently the twenty-three-year-old woman had come to
      terms with the loss of all the other members of her large family. Recently married
      and visibly pregnant, she eagerly awaited her turn to emigrate to Palestine.
      </p><p>Her story, one of the most varied, comprises several types of ghettos,
      slave labor camps, and extermination centers. She begins as Warsaw fell to the
      Germans in 1939, recalling how Poles pointed her out as a Jew to Germans and
      threw her out of food lines. But Polish anti-Semitism was not unremitting. Following
      her jump from a train that she believed was carrying her and hundreds of other
      Jews to Treblinka, a Polish policeman working for the Germans directed her to
      a nearby ghetto rather than turn her over to the German patrols, which would
      have meant being shot on the spot.</p><p>Her escape from the death train was
      the first of many bold and risky acts to stay alive. Sick in the Auschwitz infirmary,
      she avoided being selected for the gas chamber by hiding among the Christian
      patients. Later, at Bergen-Belsen, she courted death by stealing turnips to
      keep from starving along with the other inmates. She also took chances for others,
      notably in the case of a stranger’s child who attached herself to Epstein-Kozlowski.
      Others helped her, particularly the Jewish prisoners of war at Majdanek who
      stole medicine to help her recover from malaria.</p><p>On the other hand, her
      story contains little indication of more active resistance to the Germans. The
      bodies sprawled in the streets as Epstein-Kozlowski entered the Miedzyrzec ghetto
      suggest that some of the Jews there may have tried to run away when the Germans
      came to deport them. By then fragmentary information about extermination centers
      had reached some of the ghettos. But if so, that was the end of defiance. During
      the period when flight might have been possible, Epstein-Kozlowski tells us
      that she simply “sat” in the ghetto, hiding from deportations but otherwise
      passively waiting for something to happen. Nor is there any indication of organized
      resistance to the ghetto’s Jewish Council or its Jewish police force during
      the eight months she was there.</p><p>Epstein-Kozlowski also has something to
      say about the perpetrators. The murderous Christmas eve raid by the SS on the
      Miedzyrzec ghetto more nearly resembles a perverted game than the dutiful act
      of reluctant murderers. Moreover, if she was spared from the crematorium at
      Auschwitz as part of an effort to provide witnesses to “humanitarian” behavior
      by the Germans, it suggests that already in 1943 at least some SS  doctors were
      preparing to save themselves from the full force of postwar justice.</p><p>After
      returning to Poland in 1945, Epstein-Kozlowski joined a kibbutz, married another
      survivor, and together with her new husband took the underground road through
      Czechoslovakia and Germany to a cooperative camp near Como, Italy, run by the
      Hachsharah with the aid of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee
      and UNRRA, which is where she spoke with Boder.</p>\n"

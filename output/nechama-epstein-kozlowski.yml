        This is Mrs. Nechamah Epstein, 23 [years old], a nice looking..a neat looking
        woman already in the sixth or so month of pregnancy—very cheerful, very proud
        of it. And she lives here with her husband in a co-operative camp, a co-operative
        group, in a castle near Como which is being maintained by the Hachshara under
        the auspices of the American Joint Distribution Committee and, apparently,
        UNRRA."

        said that I should go away quickly. [Pause.] The struggle for life was stronger
        than anything. I left my brother on the road. I do not know what happened
        to his bones. And I went on. I had walked with that little girl for about
        three hours. Dark it was. Through woods, through fields we crawled, crawled,
        crawled. [The word crawled is repeated by an echo of the large room of the
        castle where the interview took place, and is clearly heard on the wire.]
        Suddenly Polish police arrived. He asked us where we are going. He wanted
        to arrest us. He wanted to had us over to the German authorities. We started
        to cry bitterly. That child cried bitterly. She begged [that] they should

        don’t know what will be. In the meantime I had heard gentiles talking, that
        Germans prowl on this road looking for Jews. And I saw it is bad. With the
        child I cannot walk. So I took the child. I did not know what to do. I carried
        her perhaps...perhaps, who knows, a kilometer or two. I myself did not have
        any strength. I was barefoot. My shoes had remained in the RR-car, because
        I had undressed. I did not have the time to put anything on. I was completely
        naked and barefoot. And that child remained in the field. And I went away.
        I could not help any more at all. The child had fallen, and I could not do

        Council, and I sat. It was not worth it. Every four weeks there were new deportations.
        From the small towns all around and around Jews were brought in there. And
        there was a sort of an assembly depot for Jews. And from there all the Jews
        were being sent to Treblinka. There I lived through three terrible deportations.
        During the first deportation I hid in an open attic and lay there for four
        weeks. I lived just on raw beets.

        beets, because I had nothing more to eat. And thus I nourished myself for
        four weeks, till there had passes a [in Polish] deportation...[in German;]
        a deportation. It lasted four weeks, that deportation. After the deportation
        we came down from the attic. At that time a lot of Jews had also been shot.

        that someone is chopping wood. We jump up. We hear shooting. They began shooting.
        We lay in great deathly fear. And they were knocking on our door. And I did
        not know why they could not enter through the door. I the morning I got up.
        I opened the door. A shot person fell into...into my room, itno the house
        where we were lying. When we came in [into the other rooms] there lay shot
        all who were living in those rooms. Two children with a father who were sleeping
        in bed, everything was shot. A man lay with his stomach completely torn open,
        his guts outside on the ground. And later Jewish police came in. The Germans
        had left, and we had to clean up the blood and all that. There was lying the
        bedding and the shot. All that we had to clean up. There were also two men

        I and some other girl were there, a friend of mine. We covered the mouth and
        the nose so as not to smell. We took off the bandage and took off the snakes.
        Then it became a little easier for him. The same day, in the afternoon, he
        died. He died. I was there for a time in the Ghetto, and I lived through another
        deportation. There was a large synagogue. There all the Jews were assembled.
        In the synagogue it was terrible. They simply came in...if they heard a cry,
        they shot in. The threw grenades. They beat. They truck. They did not give
        anything to drink. We had to relieve ourselves on the same place where we
        slept. I was there a whole night. I saw it was bad. I did not want to go to
        death. I went on fighting against it. I went over to a window. It was on the
        first floor. We took two towels, I and another girl. We lowered the towels
        from the windows, and we crawled down and escaped down into a cellar, and
        there we again lived through the second [other] deportation.

        any more. It only lasted three days, and then we went out again. Again we
        lived [there] a few months. During the last deportation I was not able to
        hide any more. I was led away into a transport. It was a beautiful summer
        day. It was very beautiful. It was May Day, May.

        day and a night. We were taken down to Majdanek. Many were saying that we
        were being taken to Treblinka, but the direction was toward Majdanek. We were
        taken off at the Majdanek                        lager. We were all lined
        up. There were many who were shot. They were taken down, those who were still
        alive. They were taken down on the square, and they were immediately shot
        to death. The mothers were put separ tely, the children separately, the men
        separately, the women separately, young [people] separately, old [people]
        separately. Everything was separated. The women, the young women, were taken
        to the Majdanek                        lager. The men were taken to another

        know yet what such a thing as a lager means. In the morning, at six in the
        morning, came in a German [woman], an SS women, and started to chase [us]
        with a large strap, beat everybody. We were lying on the beds, grieved, with
        great worries, thinking where the mothers were, where the fathers and the
        children were. We were crying. Then came in a German [woman] at six in the
        morning with a large strap and beat us over the head to go out to the appell.
        On the appell.it could happen that we would stand four, five hours.

        this was about. Many children of about sixteen years hid in an attic. They
        were afraid to come out. They thought they were going to be shot.

        were no toilets there, so we carried it in buckets [barrows]. We were not
        given [anything] to eat. They were hitting [us] over the legs. They were beating
        [us] over the heads. The food consisted of two hundred grams of bread a day,
        and a little soup [made] of water with [leaves of] nettles. This was the food.
        And I was there two month’s time. The hunger there was so great that when
        a caldron of food was brought, we could not wait for it to be distributed,
        but we threw ourselves on the food, and that food would spill on the ground,
        and with the mud we ate it. After having been there two months, there began...they
        began to select the healthy, healthy children who are able to work. At that
        time they began to select. They tested the heart. Whoever had the smallest
        blemish on the body did not come out [any more] from there. Only six hundred
        women were picked out, and I was among them. This was in...this was in [in

        Arriving in Oswiecim, we were led into a large hall before taking us to be

        [people] to the crematory. During each time I lived through much deathly fear.
        My whole method of saving myself was that I hid myself. Christian [women]
        were lying there, so I climbed over to the Christians, into their beds, and

        the sky. And we could not help at all. Sometimes, when we would go out at
        night to relieve ourselves, we saw how illuminated...how transports were brought

        but ultimately it turned out to be quite different. We were taken in a closed
        one. But we have only heard this. Driving past the guard we heard, ‘Sixty-six

        twenty men from Oswiecim. I was very interested in finding out what had been
        done with those women who had been together with us in Majdanek, these three
        hundred women. [When] I asked about the women from Majdanek, he told me at
        once. ‘Those beautiful women, yes, those smart ones. Alas, they are no more.’
        They had all been brought to Oswiecim. They were tattooed, kept all night
        in a block. In the middle of the night they were all called together and led
        into the cermatory. They were very heroic. They broke the windows. They would
        not let themselves be burned. But, alas, it was of no avail. The SS were stronger
        than they. Some threw themselves on [attacked] the SS men. For that they were
        taken and thrown alive in the oven [pits].

        and thus the three hundred women perished. We suffered very much from it.
        We could not stand it. We cried very much, because they wanted very much to
        live. They were always saying, ‘We lived through such terrible moments in
        Majdanek, we will surely remain alive already. We stood over the open graves
        [and] they let us live and they let us live. Perhaps we will yet remain alive.’

        gave me a little piece of bread to eat. [Once] when they brought the children

        mothers, because the mothers were immediately taken away. And the children
        separately. And the children were...they did not have enough time to take
        along the mothers. They grabbed the children and ran with them. And the children
        were brought to Plaszow. I took that little girl. I was with that little girl
        for four months. That child was very dear to me. I loved it very much. That
        child could not go anyplace without me. I was thinking I shall live through
        this war. I will be very happy with such a pretty and smart little girl, because
        it had hurt me very much that I had lost my brother’s children. And I cheered

        not sleep. But suddenly the child fell asleep in my arms. I left the child
        lying on the ground and went over to some man who worked there in the shower-bath,
        and I pleaded with him. I lied to him. I said it was my sister’s child, and
        he should see to help me save the child. So he said, ‘You know what? Tomorrow
        morning you will all be undressed nude, and you will all be led before the
        doctor. He will make such a selection. And the child, ‘he says,’ you will
        tell to hide in the your [rags] when you will undress.’ And that child was
        very clever. She did not even take off the shoes. She hid. And she hid in

        We went to the garbage heap and picked the peels from the turnips that were
        cooked in the kitchen. And if one chance to grab a turnip....I was very daring
        [?]. I did everything. I fought strongly to stay alive. So I got out through
        the gate, where they were shooting, and grabbed a turnip. And a minute later
        they shot a girl who grabbed a turnip. I ran into the block.

        dead ones, assaulted me, that I should give them [some] too. I shared it with
        them. We rejoiced. We finished the meal and went to sleep. After having been
        [there] three months, a German came again, and again selected Jews. I did
        not know where to [turn]. But I only wanted [to go] on, on. It always seemed
        to me here it is no good, there it will be better. And again I traveled. They

        [word not clear]. We could not imagine that we are to remain alive after such
        experiences, being in such murderous hands. But they would bring us newspapers.
        We read the newspapers. We saw that it is really so, that the deliverance
        is coming, that the Germans are in a bad way, that the Americans are approaching.
        We began believing [to have faith] a little. There was an...an over-...overseer,

        yes, you have nothing to think about. Comes the moment when all of you will
        have to go with uncovered breasts to be shot.’ And we, alas, would go home
        with emittered hearts. We cried terribly. Why should we not live to see freedom?
        Why do we deserve it? But it was not so. For him it was death. And we, for
        us, indeed, came the time that we were liberated, but it still took a long
        time yet. It took another month. After being there for perhaps two months
        there came another order. There had begun strong air-raids. We ran...every
        night we were led into a forest to a bunker. They said we have to run away.
        They were afraid for themselves. They did not take us so that we should be
        saved, but they wanted to save themselves, and they did not want to leave
        us alone, because they were afraid we will escape. And they dragged us. We
        were working night shift. Snow was falling. Three, four times a night they
        called alarm, and we had to get out and run to the forest, to the trench [?]
        They had made such a pit, and there to hide. We suffered like that for a few
        weeks. The Americans began approaching. In the middle of the night they suddenly
        woke all of us up and called out ‘Everybody out,’ to get out this instant.

        not even a stable, so they led us down to a forest. We were thinking, here

      u: But we were not allowed to say anything, because we were in their hands.
        We arrived in Theresienstadt. There were only Jews, many Jews from Germany.
        There were very many old women who were...mixed [intermarried], Germans and
        Jews. They had Jewish sons, SS men...not Jewish sons’ SS men, but their sons
        were SS men. They were serving Hitler, and she...she was Jewish; the husband
        was a German. And that is the reason they remained alive. All old, grey women.
        And all the children with mothers had been transported to Auschwitz before,
        yet. And they were permitted to survive the war. Finally we arrived there.
        Short and sharp [to the point], we were there two months, eight weeks. We
        didn’t received [anything] to eat. It was very little food. And the Germans
        prepared a large crematory. They had heard that the front is again approaching.
        They prepared a large crematory, but they did not have enough time to do it.
        One nice day they called together all the Jews, and they wanted to make an
        air-raid alarm so that we go down into that bunker. There came a German and
        betrayed [divulged] all that. He said that if he will be escorted to Switzerland,
        [then] this will not be carried out. He was promised [that]. The Swiss Red
        Cross took us over, and all of us were saved.

        people began to eat, to eat too much, greedily. And that was harmful for them.
        There was a great epidemic. Hundreds of people fell a day. After the liberation,
        two, three, days after the liberation, there had fallen very many people.
        In about a month half of the lager had fallen. And nothing could be done about
        it until it...there were full stables, full with dead. People crawled over
        the dead. It stank terribly. There was raging a severe typhus. And I, too,
        got sick. I lay four weeks in the hospital. [See the story of Mr. Schlaefrig,

      u: But in July ’42, I was arrested one morning at six o’clock by the...two French
        police.On July 16th and 17th in 1942, some 4,500 French policemen rounded  up
        a total of 12,884 mostly foreign-born Jews in Paris who had not become naturalized
        French citizens. Nearly 10,000 of those arrested were women and children.
        Although Mrs. Precker saved herself by bribing the two French policemen who
        came to arrest her, the fact that she was a French-born Jew might have played
        a role in her release. Few of those arrested in the July roundup survived.2

        of southeastern France. Until the collapse of the Italian fascist government
        and the withdrawal of Italian troops from the zone in September 1943, some
        50,000 Jews, among them the Mrs. Precker and her family, had sought refuge
        there. Most refugees, like Mrs. Precker and her family, at first went to the
        city of Nice. After the departure of Italian troops, the family moved to Cannes.3

        in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the increase in resistance activity throughout
        the country, deportation of Jews to the infamous Drancy camp in the suburbs
        of Paris continued, as did deportations from Drancy to Auschwitz. A convoy
        of some 1,300 Drancy internees left for Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. Mrs. Precker
        and her family narrowly missed sharing their fate.5

        they had lived in during the German occupation. In the postwar period, French

      u: All right, Ms. Precker that is some very interesting material and I thank
        you very much. This is a Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording taken
        from Ms. Marcel Precker working at present at the American Joint Distribution
        Committee and...she was born in Paris and continues to live here. All right,
        thank you.

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Marcelle Precker was born in Paris to well-to-do Jewish parents. There
      is no indication in her interview that she had any siblings. She and her husband
      had one child, but her husband died in 1939, the year before France fell to
      the Germans. In the wake of the German occupation, Mrs. Precker’s parents and
      her young daughter fled south into the area controlled by the Vichy government.</p><p>Mrs.
      Precker remained in Paris to protect her father’s fur business and the family’s
      upscale apartment. She narrowly escaped arrest during the infamous roundup of
      Paris Jews on July 16 and 17, 1942. She then went to southern France to rejoin
      her family. They resided for a time in the city of Nice, which was in the Italian
      zone of occupation from June 1940 to September 8, 1943. During this time, the
      Italians treated Jews in their zone benevolently.</p><p>Following the collapse
      of Italy’s fascist government and the signing by the successor regime of an
      armistice with the Allies, the Germans occupied the Italian zone of southeastern
      France, and Mrs. Precker and her family moved to Cannes, where they were arrested
      in late June 1944. After spending about a month in prison, they were shipped
      to the notorious Drancy camp located in a suburb of Paris. They remained there
      for about three weeks until they were liberated shortly before Paris fell to
      the Allies on August 25, 1944.</p><p>Mrs. Precker’s account of her experiences
      illustrates the fanatic obsessiveness with which the Nazis pursed the “Final
      Solution to the Jewish Question” even when they were on the very edge of military
      defeat. Indeed, the imperative to murder every single Jew persisted up until
      the collapse of the Nazi regime. Mrs. Precker’s story also demonstrates the
      importance of luck, which played a crucial role in her escape from the July
      1942 Paris roundup, and was an important factor in preventing the deportation
      of Mrs. Precker and her family from Drancy to Auschwitz and almost certain death.
      They were saved from this fate because they arrived in the camp shortly before
      Paris fell to the Allies. Finally, like so many survivors, though scarred and
      traumatized by their experiences, Mrs. Precker and her family were able to rebuild
      their lives after the war.</p>"

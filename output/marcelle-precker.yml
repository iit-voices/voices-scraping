        Paris, August the 12th, 1946 at the headquarters of the American Joint Distribution
        Committee. The interviewee is Mrs. Marcelle Precker born in France who spent
        here the time during the occupation. Also, Mrs. Precker, will you please tell

      end: '00:01:16.516'
      u: I was just [arrested?]As we learn subsequently, although the Germans occupied
        Paris in June 1940, Mrs. Precker narrowly escaped arrest in July 1942 and
        was arrested with her family in June 1944 in the city of Cannes.1

      end: '00:01:23.044'
      u: No. My family was in the south—in the south of France.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:23.044'
      end: '00:01:24.114'
      u: With your child?

      start: '00:01:24.114'
      end: '00:01:24.868'
      u: With my child.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:24.868'
      end: '00:01:26.707'
      u: Why did they go there?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:01:26.707'
      end: '00:01:31.652'
      u: They went to south of France to escape from the Germans.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:31.652'
      end: '00:01:35.722'
      u: To escape from the Germans. And you remained here...
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:01:35.722'
      end: '00:01:43.351'
      u: I tried to remain in Paris to save our apartment and my father’s business.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:01:43.351'
      end: '00:01:50.452'
      u: All right. And so...(mumbling) will you close the...yes. And so, what happened?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:01:50.452'
      end: '00:01:58.668'
      u: But in July ’42, I was arrested one morning at six o’clock by the...two French
        police.On July 16th and 17th in 1942, some 4,500 French policemen rounded  up
        a total of 12,884 mostly foreign-born Jews in Paris who had not become naturalized
        French citizens. Nearly 10,000 of those arrested were women and children.
        Although Mrs. Precker saved herself by bribing the two French policemen who
        came to arrest her, the fact that she was a French-born Jew might have played
        a role in her release. Few of those arrested in the July roundup survived.2

      start: '00:01:58.668'
      end: '00:02:03.462'

    - who: David Boder

    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:08.047'
      end: '00:03:09.977'
      u: It was at Cannes.Like Nice, Cannes was formerly in the Italian-occupied zone
        of southeastern France. Until the collapse of the Italian fascist government
        and the withdrawal of Italian troops from the zone in September 1943, some
        50,000 Jews, among them the Mrs. Precker and her family, had sought refuge
        there. Most refugees, like Mrs. Precker and her family, at first went to the
        city of Nice. After the departure of Italian troops, the family moved to Cannes.3
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:09.977'

      u: At Cannes and you were arrested the whole family?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:13.113'
      end: '00:03:16.173'
      u: The whole family. My father, my mother, my daughter and I.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:16.173'
      end: '00:03:18.073'
      u: Yes. How old was your daughter?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:18.073'
      end: '00:03:21.766'
      u: My daughter was at that moment eleven years old.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:21.766'
      end: '00:03:23.003'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:23.003'
      end: '00:03:26.425'
      u: We were put in the prison...in the prison.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:26.425'
      end: '00:03:28.385'
      u: In the prison, yes...
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:28.385'
      end: '00:03:33.707'
      u: We stayed there some days and put in another prison at Nice.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:33.707'
      end: '00:03:34.928'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:34.928'
      end: '00:03:38.486'
      u: And after eight days we were put in a train.Given the fact that Mrs. Precker
        and her family arrived in Drancy at the beginning of August 1944, they must
        have spent over a month in the two prisons in Nice.4
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:38.486'
      end: '00:03:39.526'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Marcelle Precker

      start: '00:03:42.119'
      end: '00:03:44.049'

    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:44.049'
      end: '00:03:47.501'
      u: Taken to Drancy. The concentration camp Drancy.Despite the Allied landings
        in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the increase in resistance activity throughout
        the country, deportation of Jews to the infamous Drancy camp in the suburbs
        of Paris continued, as did deportations from Drancy to Auschwitz. A convoy
        of some 1,300 Drancy internees left for Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. Mrs. Precker
        and her family narrowly missed sharing their fate.5
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:47.501'
      end: '00:03:50.004'
      u: Yes, now Drancy is where?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:03:50.004'
      end: '00:03:52.853'
      u: Is near Paris.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:03:52.853'

      u: Yes, and so? [pause] Well what happened in Drancy?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:04:04.929'
      end: '00:04:09.678'
      u: I have to tell you that at Nice my father was...[trails off]

    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:39.403'
      end: '00:04:41.710'
      u: In Nice your father was beaten by the Germans?This must have occurred subsequent
        to the German occupation of Nice that began the evening of September 8, 1943.
        Two days later Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann’s deputy, and highly trained
        SS police entered Nice and began a brutal roundup of Jews which, however,
        was inhibited by the lack of cooperation by many non-Jewish French men and
        women.6

      u: Why?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:04:43.082'
      end: '00:04:50.846'
      u: Why, because we are...the Germans had found in our [unintelligible] for English
        papers.It is not clear from Mrs. Precker’s testimony what sort of papers these
        were, but they raised German suspicions of a link between her father and their
        English enemy.7
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:04:50.846'
      end: '00:04:53.484'

        I don’t know how we managed to keep them just at that moment because it was
        a very dangerous moment.

      u: Yes. (mumbling instructions) Get your hands down...Each day they arrested
        a few families? All right. And how many people were you taken to Drancy?

      u: All right. In Drancy where did they put you? Did they separate the men from
        the women?
    - who: Marcelle Precker
      start: '00:06:03.422'
      end: '00:06:08.970'
      u: No. Had to...we’re to...go in Germany after that.They were probably told
        that they were going to be sent to Germany for forced labor and that their
        family would be kept together for the sake of family unity, whereas in reality
        they would have been sent to Auschwitz. The Germans regularly used deceptive
        techniques to hide the “Final Solution” from their victims.8

        All right. And then...the people moved out from your apartment without much
        argument.

        their apartments and so they have difficulty in getting their apartments back?
        They say that there are still some people who have not gotten their apartments
        back by now?

      end: '00:17:34.558'
      u: Yes. It’s the only reason.Mrs. Precker means that if the apartments were
        occupied by people from areas surrounding Paris who had had their homes destroyed,
        she believes that they were able to at least temporarily remain in the apartments
        they had lived in during the German occupation. In the postwar period, French
        Jewry had only partial success in reclaiming the apartments and businesses
        of those who had been deported.20

        was eleven years old in 1944, and this interview took place in August 1946,
        her account is inconsistent in this regard.21

        of work Mrs. Precker was doing for the Joint and whether or not it was paid
        or volunteer work. In any case, Mrs. Precker was working for an organization
        which at the time was providing invaluable aid to survivors of Nazi tyranny.23

        I mean this...Well there were of course all kind of French. There were some
        who were collaborating with the Germans...

      u: And there were others who were fighting the Germans and so on. Now, uh, what
        do they think? How soon will France come back to normal?As Boder indicates,
        some French men and women during the years of German occupation behaved with
        cruelty or cold indifference, while others demonstrated compassion and selflessness.
        In the immediate postwar period, however, the myth of France as a nation of
        resisters, apart from a few collaborators and traitors, predominated.24

        Committee and...she was born in Paris and continues to live here. All right,

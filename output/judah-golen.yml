      u: Germany, Wiesbaden, September the 26th. I think I marked yesterday the records
        “the 26th” so I will have to make a correction. I am really overstaying my
        time [intelligible?] and they can’t send me one anyway before...eight o’clock
        tonight. I am...it is Rosh Hashanah and the Jewish community is in the synagogue—the
        synagogue which I’ve been told has not yet been officially dedicated but has
        of course Rosh Hashanah services in...after the chaplain has said...what’s
        the chaplain’s name?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:00:39.231'
      end: '00:00:39.711'
      u: Darling.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:00:39.711'
      end: '00:01:38.948'
      u: ". . . as Chaplain Darling from the United States Army, Chaplain Darling
        has said, it’s after seven years the first Rosh Hashanah service in the synagogue.
        I am taking time out. I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services
        later but I’m taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a
        representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,—for Palestine—and since
        I have met a number of these men and women...often in Italy and France on
        railroad trains and so on...I have decided to take out this morning out and
        he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives
        of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred
        people working in the various DP camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind
        first of all to tell who you are and then let’s go on with the story. The
        microphone is yours for as much time as you want."
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:01:38.948'
      end: '00:02:05.334'
      u: Well, um, I myself am a Palestinian. Born in Palestine, Jerusalem; the son
        of parents who were born in Palestine—and the grandson of grandfather and
        grandmother who were born in Palestine. I had my education in Palestine and
        in Great Britain—in England. I am an advocate by profession...

      u: A what?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:02:05.904'
      end: '00:02:06.744'
      u: An advocate.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:06.744'
      end: '00:02:07.704'
      u: A lawyer.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:02:07.704'
      end: '00:02:51.520'
      u: ". . . by profession but I am also attached as a legal advisor to the political
        department of the Jewish Agency. I have volunteered a few months ago to go
        to Europe and see what one can do for the remnants of the Jews who are still
        in Europe. My object is really to be in Austria and establish there the connections,
        and the machinery, for dealing with the Jews who are there and who are passing
        from Eastern Europe to the Western side with an idea to come later to Palestine."
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:02:51.520'
      end: '00:02:53.230'
      u: "[inaudible]...wait a minute..."
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:02:53.230'
      end: '00:02:54.040'
      u: "..go ahead."
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:02:54.040'
      end: '00:04:22.858'
      u: I want to...My object is to stay as I said in Austria and open there first
        of all a Palestine office. The...I’m going to have a small mission of some
        fifteen men and women from Palestine who would be spread all over Austria
        to the various camps—in the various camps—and do first of all the cultural
        and instructive work among the DPs. The, um, to tell you how the whole thing
        started it would be a rather a long story but the first...Jews who arrived
        in Europe during the war and immediately after...victory were the Jews from
        Palestine who served in the Jewish brigades which is now known all over the
        world. They were the first who reached the remnants of our brothers and succeeded
        in getting to a far point in—within Russia itself. They then organized and
        helped those Jews to come over to the Allies and...rather Western side of
        Europe. Would you stop the...
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:04:22.858'
      end: '00:05:23.565'
      u: Now, uh, after the Jewish brigade had to leave Europe and go back to Palestine
        for demobilization the Jewish Agency for Palestine decided to send a number
        of Jewish shluchim which called really “messengers” from Palestine to the
        Jews in Europe. The Jewish Agency has contacted the UNRRA...UNRRA authorities
        who are very sympathetic and who assisted in having a number of Jews from
        Palestine come over to Europe. The JAFP—which means the Jewish agency for
        Palestine is now in Europe—in Germany—as a separate unit attached to the UNRRA.
        There are now about a hundred of such men and women doing work in the various
        camps, among the DPs in conjunction with UNRRA.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:05:23.565'
      end: '00:05:26.445'
      u: May I ask a question? How is that financially handled?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:05:26.445'
      end: '00:06:00.917'
      u: Well, the Jewish agency pays their expenses as to if a man has to get his
        salary for example, he is paid by the Jewish agency. On the other hand the
        UNRRA keeps the men in Germany and covers, as many other members of the UNRRA,
        their economic and traveling expenses. I wouldn’t say all traveling expenses—a
        major part is being paid by the Jewish Agency. But various facilities are
        sympathetically given by the UNRRA....another question?
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:00.917'
      end: '00:06:02.477'
      u: No. Go ahead.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:06:02.477'
      end: '00:06:13.877'
      u: So, the hundred of men and women are spread all over Germany—British and
        American Zones. As I said I don’t want...I want to limit myself to my own
        function.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:13.877'
      end: '00:06:14.117'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:06:14.117'
      end: '00:06:53.718'
      u: My immediate object is to leave for Vienna in a few days and come in contact
        there with UNRRA authorities in Vienna and Austria so that we can establish
        a unit of the Jewish Agency in Austria. “What are these men and women from
        Palestine doing in the camp?” First of all, one should realize the mental
        and physical situation of the Jews who arrived a few months ago from Poland
        and who are coming here with strong stream from Poland and even Russia.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:06:53.718'
      end: '00:07:00.228'
      u: Excuse me, when you speak “arrived a few months ago from Poland” you speak
        about those what the UNRRA calls “infiltrees”
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:07:00.228'
      end: '00:07:01.908'
      u: That’s right. That’s right.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:01.908'
      end: '00:07:03.978'
      u: Well, are you interested only in the “infiltrees?”
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:07:03.978'
      end: '00:07:56.075'
      u: No, no we are—our men are mainly stationed in the various DP camps where
        you have...I mean...there’s a man or who is coming to a DP camp is a member
        of an UNRRA team and his duty is to do for these DPs whatever the UNRRA would
        tell him. But as there are Jews from Palestine, they have the ability and
        possibility to deal in more cultural work for the Jews in the DP. They are
        also serving as instructors in various—I would say—in vocational work. We
        have organized in various...around some camps in Germany kind of...groups
        of youth—Jewish youth, who are taking agricultural and other training. We
        have...

      u: Agricultural...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:07:57.425'
      end: '00:07:59.795'
      u: Isn’t that done with the ORT—in conjunction with the ORT?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:07:59.795'
      end: '00:08:12.245'
      u: It is done with-in conjunction with the ORT in full harmony and in conjunction
        and with the full help with all AJDC and other Jewish and certainly not forget
        the UNRRA...help.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:08:12.245'

      u: AJDC is the American Jewish Agency?
    - who: Judah Golen

      u: No. It’s America Joint...

      u: All right.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:08:25.355'
      end: '00:09:14.421'
      u: Which is well-known and one of the biggest associations not just in America
        and all over the world. The connection between the Jewish Agency and the AJDC
        in Europe is rather strong and as far as I could see from the last two or
        three weeks I have been in Munich—in Munich, in Germany—the relations are
        very good. I have met a great number of AJDC men and ORT men and I see that
        in one respect, in respect of helping the brothers—all our own brothers—the
        men on the [spot?] have understood that is one thing and that is harmony among
        the workers so that the Jews who are here should only gain by the presence
        of such an organization. Now...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:09:14.421'
      end: '00:09:40.356'
      u: Mr. Golen I think you have made here an interesting point. There are two
        schools of thought some people constantly kick that there is duplication—that
        too many different agencies do the same thing. Just to say personally I want
        to say right now that I don’t agree with that. What do you think?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:09:40.356'
      end: '00:10:43.072'
      u: Well I associate myself with your view. I don’t think there is duplication.
        ‘A:’ I consider that there is a lack of men all over....of Jews from more
        liberated countries like America, Palestine, France, England who can do a
        great deal for those people who are in the DPs. But as to the question of
        duplication I don’t consider that duplication. What we, the Jewish Agency,
        is doing now is “A:”...the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language
        is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do
        not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the
        people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with
        the aid of the AJDC—the teachers come from Palestine. Some money and other
        help is being given by the other institutions. The Hebrew language is being
        taught to the children and other subjects are being taught in Hebrew.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:10:43.072'
      end: '00:10:54.022'
      u: Excuse me another point for interrupting I know it is terrible nuisance.
        What money is considered? Would you say the money comes exclusively from America?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:10:54.022'
      end: '00:10:58.702'
      u: Well, I would not say that. Although I would say a great deal of money is
        coming from America...
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:10:58.702'
      end: '00:10:59.092'
      u: But...
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:10:59.092'
      end: '00:12:13.465'
      u: But I, from my own experience in Palestine, I know that they have many collections
        being organized among the Jewish population who count now about 650,000 in
        Palestine and I know practically every Jew in Palestine has been contributing
        to these various Jewish institutions whose object is also—I mean who includes
        in that program helping the Jews in the Diaspora. I know that during the war
        the first, I would say, the first who succeeded in sending over help in money
        and in other ways—I mean in clothing and books and so on to Europe, to the
        people who were still in the...under the enemy regime, were the Palestinians.
        But I would not say that they did it themselves. It’s known and I know it
        from my own personal knowledge that the AJDC...helped a great deal. I mean
        they really supplied the money and the Jews of Palestine found a way to send
        it over, with their own money collected from Palestine, to the ghetto in Warsaw...to
        Poland and to other places in Europe when the Germans were still there.

      u: Nu. Continue.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:12:14.995'
      end: '00:13:55.033'
      u: "“Now, what is the Jewish...?” I do not—I am not confident to speak for the
        AJDC as I am not a member. I can only say...speak from my own experience that
        what I saw...the various action or the various help—aid—which is being given
        by the AJDC is greatly appreciated and it should continue. What I can say
        is more about the JAFP which is as I said a separate unit in the UNRRA—within
        the UNRRA. Now...as I said there are hundreds already in Pales—Germany, both
        zones, British and American. As far as I know the UNRRA are very, very satisfied
        with these men because...mentally they know how to approach DPs. And the DPs
        whose aim throughout the war and before the war and now, was Palestine, which
        they considered the only...as I said at the time -wartime- the only thing
        which remained for them was to go to Palestine. They would take a Jew from
        Palestine more into their confidence than any other person. Also the question
        of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew
        from Poland whether it’s Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised
        to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries
        in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew—speak fluent Hebrew—which is again
        a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine. Would you like
        to know anything?"
    - who: David Boder
      start: '00:13:55.033'
      end: '00:14:27.118'
      u: 'Yes. Well...So let us continue about this...Let me ask you this question:
        “In your impression—you mentioned the poor—do all DPs, all displaced Jews,
        or all of we couldn’t say, but what do you estimate? What percentage of the
        DPs and which age groups long for Palestine and which one would want to go
        to America, South America, Australia, South Africa and other places?” You
        couldn’t say that everyone wants to go to Palestine?'
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '00:14:27.118'
      end: '00:16:42.195'
      u: Well I’ll you exactly how it is—I’ll tell you. Immediately after the war
        and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews
        in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some
        energy to...stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has
        been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties—we
        cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and
        outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not
        bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But...and these difficulties naturally
        caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those
        elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and
        they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after
        seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some
        peace—peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where
        they have relatives there, people move for America—especially the United States—I...and
        people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from—and
        you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that
        all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who
        have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter
        a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large.
        Neither America, although America has shown a great—what should I say—great
        generosity...I can’t...whether this is the word...towards accepting Jews into
        their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter
        of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German
        zones—not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland.

        the British and American zone and Austria have now two hundred thousand Jews."

      start: '00:17:16.755'

        given to the Jewish Agency were to be deducted on that account so that for

        is caused to the various Jews in Europe, Jews in Palestine and the Jews all
        over the world, and will increase the figure to a height which would at least

It’s really encouraging to see, when one comes into a DP camp, to see the various children sitting in school—in schools, being taught by a Palestinian teacher Hebrew and other subjects in Hebrew. This question of education should really be stressed and more than stressed. Boys who for over six months had no learning at all; whatever they learned when they were let’s say six, seven years old or even ten years old they must have forgotten and for six years they have not seen a book, they have not planned to read, they have not progressed in teaching—in learning. These boys—you can see boys of fifteen, sixteen, who are starting now to learn the alphabet—the ABC’s. And they are doing it very enthusiastically and energetically and the hope is that in about a year or so the loss of time that these people have undergone will be regained by more...by industrials and energetic learning.

        They don’t have it in Russia because the Jewish Agency has not been able to establish direct connections with the Russian government till now. If you ask me why, I can’t tell you. Better ask the Russians for this purpose. But we have it in Sweden, we have it in Germany now, in Munich, we have it in other towns around the American zone. Where there is the Palestinian office—a Palestinian office—who do the examining work, who should get a certificate, and who is...who should be able to proceed to Palestine immediately under those certificates. As I said, unfortunately, the number of certificates is so small that it’s become rather...the certificate is less important than anything because of its...the difficulty of getting it...because of its non-existence, I would say. The Palestinian offices have now almost no work to do. But the Jewish Agency is establishing these Palestinian offices with the hope that certificates would be granted—in a greater number—and then the work would start again. “What are the Palestinian offices doing exactly and how do they give the certificates?” There are various categories: “A:” there are relatives in Palestine like fathers who have their sons in Europe or husbands who have left their wives in Europe—these have the priority. Again, you have sons who have their parents, sisters who have their brothers—these have, again, the priority. After that comes the efficiency of the man. You have the various movements—youth movements—who organize their members in various works, [so it should be?] as I’ve said before, these kibbutzei

And the group goes over to Palestine as a group. There, they are immediately absorbed in one of the settlements so that the economic question is not existing at all. Again you have, before the war we had also a category of “capitalists.” That we, as Jews who owned over a thousand pounds, were allowed to be given—were allowed to come to Palestine under such certificate. These were also distributed in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. But government itself—British government—could also give certificates for people without even consulting the Jewish Agency (as to this question of these capitalists). We have also “professional certificates.” Doctors and other professional...professions who would receive certificates in the same way as capitalists received certificates. The...

        after consulting the various Palestinian offices in the various countries
        and decide how many certificates should be sent to the various....offices.
        So that they, at the time when the certificates are available, they take into
        consideration the immediate necessity of the number of certificates needed
        to a certain place. If, for example, during the war, there was hope to help
        and to save Jews from Rumania they then sent a greater number of certificates
        to Rumania at that time. Even now the Agency of certificates would...the Agency

        not allowed to come into Palestine. But, Palestine has absorbed a great number
        of people who are invalids as a result of the war and who are—who have become
        weak in health as a result of the war. On the contrary, they are even given
        more consideration and are being helped more in social...in a social respect
        than those who don’t need this help. I know, for example, being myself in
        Haifa when a boat of...arrived. Most of the people were really physically
        not well. This is not because...this was only as a result of the war. Now
        I understand that these people are healthy people, and doing their work as
        any other Jew does work in Palestine.

        identify the spool that way but it’s my last day in Germany. It is Rosh Hashanah.
        The Jewish community, maintained by the UNRRA, is having its first Rosh Hashanah
        services which they are rebuilding with their own hands. And which has been
        seven years ago, according to Capt. and Chaplain Darling, desecrated. But
        I am taking advantage of the morning to get some additional material although
        I would like to record at least a part of the services which I still may do.
        My interviewee is Mr. Golen a Palestinian-born, a third generation Palestinian,
        who is working with the Jewish Agency for Palestine here. We have covered
        all of spool 160 and I am going over now to spool 161. Illinois Institute

        without distinction of race or creed. Also, I want to ask you a question about
        the kibbutz...kibbutz.hachshara. I was in Italy...they have there self-government.
        I saw in one room 36 young people. Men and women together, well that is common
        for all UNRRA camps. They let the Mennonites who seem to be the best organized
        live men, women, and children together in one barrack. It is not particular
        to the Jews but it seems to have been...and it is not on their fault, so to
        say, but let me ask you this question...Now let’s come back and take that
        what hurts us most: thirty-six young people in one room. Married couples when
        they are without children also in that same room. Sometimes the cots moved
        together, sometimes two people in one cot. Of course it’s all better than
        it was in the German concentration camp but “what do you think is the influence
        and the significance of such life?” “And what can be done in general about
        it?”'

      u: Well, if I understand your question correctly, you ask “why are men and women—thirty-six
        young boys and girls—living together in the same room?” I can say for certain
        the none of these thirty six young men and women would like to be all together
        in the same room in the sense of sleeping in the same room, and eating in
        the same room, and conducting...conducting their life in that room.

      u: No,—on the contrary. Well, if you take the kibbutz settlement in Palestine,
        it is a collective settlement. They have there common room where they have
        their meetings together—you cannot have a meeting separately—where they eat
        together so that labor should be...less. If the hundred men and women have
        their one room for kind of dining hall where they eat together a lot of work
        is being gained while...

        If they are married they have—these young couples—have their room or two rooms
        sometimes if the kibbutz has economic or financial possibilities to supply
        that. There is no such thing as living families in the same room together.
        No human being likes that—it’s against human nature—and these young boys and
        girls if they do conduct a life together in—as you saw, said you saw in Italy—I
        can assure you, even without my having been there, that it’s out of difficulty
        to sheer necessity to get separate rooms. The idea of the kibbutz, of the
        collective...life in the collective form, is not—is not to eliminate and forget
        the individual element. Not to...merge your individuality into the collective.
        It’s to give to the collective whatever you can give and take from it whatever
        you have to take. But the individual life of the person...the family exists

        of labor and, for example, instead of every mother having the necessity to
        give her—all her time to her child they have collected the children into separate
        children houses where a few mothers are able to give the whole day work to
        the children while the other mothers can go out to the field or can do other

        to work he doesn’t see his child every minute of the day. No. Only when he
        comes home and if he still has, even though let’s say if the woman works—if
        the woman has to prepare food and to do other things, she has no time to give
        to her child. While in the kibbutz the child is being taken care [of] by special
        nurses, or I call them “mothers” because they are members of the kibbutz who
        have their own children and the other children in these children houses. In

        a father they come back they have their meal immediately and then they have

        children, in education (to see that the children prepare their lessons if
        they are grown-up children), if they are babies they play with them in the
        little fields there and the most interesting picture in the kibbutz would
        be if you come at a certain hour let’s say it’s five o’clock in the evening
        you would see couples, parents, playing with their own children for an hour
        and two hours and you would see the parents let’s say it’s seven o’clock in

        is children on the shoulders of their fathers being taken to the children
        house to sleep and say goodbye—goodnight—to their father. In the morning the
        parents, if they have time, they see their children immediately—[that] their

        out to their own rooms and see to it that the tie between the parent and the
        son is kept not less than it’s kept in town. I would say as I’ve said before
        that these family ties, the connection between the parent and the child in
        the kibbutz is stronger because the father has time and has the possibility
        to give his time to the.. to his son. While in town, if the worker as I’ve

        worker, if he has work, has to go early morning and come late in the evening
        he is not able to speak to his son while in the kibbutz the work is so divided
        that a member has time for everything. And the...as I’ve said, he has time
        to see his children in the evenings, in the mornings, and if he doesn’t go

        her child she can take a job at the maternity house or at the baby’s house
        and take care of her own child and the other children. But the confidence
        of the mothers in their own friends in their women-friends is so strong that
        no mother would worry about her child if it’s being taken care of by a friend
        of hers. This is a question of education and I’m glad to say that the members
        of the kibbutzim have been educated by themselves out of a lot of life to
        have confidence in their own friends. And the mother would hand over her child
        to a friend of hers and would...gladly, I mean with...without any worries

        on remaining there is a person who is suitable otherwise they would have certainly

      u: It’s on lease for a hundred years but it is going over to inheritance. It
        remains the property of the Jewish nation but no person would be displaced
        as long as you work the land—as long as he proves that he does his duty as
        a farmer and as a Jew in Palestine.

      u: He cannot sell it but he can transfer it with the consent of the directorship
        of the Fund to another person. A person who has started land and who seems
        to be unable physically or for any other reason he has to leave the land,
        can have his land transferred to another [person?]. But...as he has not paid
        for it he cannot get anything for it. He may get some payment just to assist
        him in settling his life in some other way either in town or in some farm,
        in a profession or so on but the land is not his property. It is the property
        of the Jewish nation—of those who have contributed towards buying this land.

      u: Yes. That’s right. There are various forms of kibbutzim. But the usual form
        is...there is...a committee elected once a year by the general meeting of
        the members. This general meeting—the general meeting of the members is the
        deciding factor in the kibbutz. This is, I would say, the top of democracy
        expressed in these kibbutzim. The general meeting elects once a year a committee
        of some nine to ten members according to the size of the kibbutz according
        to the number of the kibbutz and each member has a job to do, each member...is
        doing a certain part of the work of the kibbutz—I mean is rather in charge
        of a certain part of the kibbutz. There is one member who is in charge of
        the cultural work of the kibbutz[what the occasions were?], there is one other
        member who would be in charge of the distribution of work in the farm. There
        is one who would be in charge of connections with outside, there is one who
        be in charge of the business side of the kibbutz. Because a kibbutz is not
        just a farm—the kibbutz will sometimes consist of over a thousand men is more
        a kind of a little colony. A thousand men is...

        of the kibbutz. The children up to a certain age cannot become—are not members,
        but when they become seventeen years old they almost automatically are joined
        to the kibbutz and become members of the kibbutz with the right to vote and
        express opinions and so on. Now...”how is it run?” As I said these members,
        each member of them has—is in charge of a certain field of activity and the
        fields are quite numerous so that the...and the coordination between the members
        is being expressed in the various meetings these members have almost three

      u: You can have...if the kibbutz consists of more than two or three hundred
        men—souls—and they have a number of children they have there an elementary
        school. First they have a kindergarten taken care of by the various nurses
        and kindergarten...teachers if you can call them this way—trainers. Then you
        have elementary schools practically in every kibbutz divided into classes
        as in any other school system. Then you have the secondary school would be
        more a combined school from the whole neighborhood of kibbutzim. You can take
        five, six kibbutzim in one neighborhood and they establish a secondary school—a
        kind of “gymnasium” -in one of the settlements where all the children or the
        boys of the various kibbutzim have their study. When the children come to
        the age of sixteen—seventeen, as I said, they can become members of the kibbutz
        but if some of these boys show special talents in some field of science or
        literature they are given the possibility to go and study...take further studies
        in town—in universities. Either it’s Hebrew university or even to go abroad.

        it in the kibbutz because there is no money in the kibbutz, there are no shops
        in the kibbutz.

      u: She can go to Haifa and buy herself a new hat and a new dress if the money
        is enough for that. And...I mean there is private property in the kibbutz.
        If you come...if you go into a room of a family in the kibbutz every member
        tries to decorate his own room according to his own taste and if he has the
        ability to buy things a make his room richer, look richer, then he can do
        it and it’s his own property. When he leaves the kibbutz he can take it with
        him. But in general, people do not have money in the kibbutz because they
        have no need of money. They get everything they need from the kibbutz itself.

      u: Well, for that there is a committee as I said and there is a general meeting.
        If, let us say, a general meeting decides to...buy some kind of....clothes,
        new clothes, for the kibbutz—for the members—the majority, usually the great
        majority decides in such a thing, then the members get it. If they decide
        to buy a library or get new books...they get the new books. If they decide
        to buy a kind of...I would say a...cinema or whatever they have it for...entertainment
        they can buy and they have it.

      u: Yeah. Now suppose let’s go that...I’m talking from an American standpoint.
        Suppose I come to Palestine and I bring my automobile to be able to visit
        the country and I later leave it as a gift to a member of the kibbutz. Can
        he keep the car?

        he can use it. Certainly.

      start: '01:01:00.684'
      end: '01:01:15.807'
      u: Of his own, certainly. Unless the kibbutz decides that the...machine or the...car
        serves for the kibbutz purpose then they give their own petrol...their own
        traveling expenses. But the property can remain the property of the member.

        a member has...But, usually, members do not look for such things as I said.

        things clear.

        been honestly acquired and has the money to run it he will be able to run
        it.

      start: '01:01:43.525'
      end: '01:02:15.599'
      u: No doubt about that. A member can have a camera which is valued more than
        even a car sometimes—it’s his own property. And nobody will ask him how he
        got it or “why doesn’t he give it to the use of the kibbutz?” Usually a member
        who has something which can serve for the purpose of the whole community—public
        opinion would make him so that he should really give it. I mean he would himself
        gladly give it to the kibbutz—I mean if there is a photographer who has a
        camera...would certainly be glad to take pictures for the whole members of
        the members of the kibbutz at the expense of the kibbutz.

      u: ". . . and I feel a lot of heckling and a lot of questioning. Let’s take
        this: Suppose a member of the kibbutz has a watch to repair and an other member
        of the kibbutz has learned in the art of somewhere watch-making, repairs it
        for him. Can one pay to the other privately for it?"
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:02:41.113'
      end: '01:03:30.809'
      u: No. There’s no such thing as money as I said and members do not have money.
        But, if a member has a watch and he has to repair it, the kibbutz will pay
        for repairing that watch either in town or in the kibbutz. That means if a
        man knows the work of watch-repairing or watch-making in the kibbutz, he will
        not be paid, it will be his profession and he gets for the work he does his
        food and his clothing and his health service and he’s being taken care of
        by the various people around—he should have been taken care of—for that he
        gives his work, whatever he can do whether its watch-making or whether its
        another way. He will not pay his friend. “A:” his friend will not ask for
        money, “B:” the kibbutz is responsible to the watch to run smoothly and they
        will pay for the repairing expenses.

    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:03:36.389'
      end: '01:04:15.751'
      u: No. There is no such thing as “paid” at all in the kibbutz. The kibbutz as
        a whole is paid with the outside market—if they sell their goods or their
        food, they get money. For this money the committee buys things for the members
        of the kibbutz. And they get it directly without having money pass through
        the hands of each individual. There is no need for money because you can do
        nothing for money. If he goes to town, he is being given an amount sufficient
        to...have him...to make him able to spend a fortnight or three weeks in town.
        Usually members of the kibbutz have their leave once a year for a fortnight
        or three weeks...

        spend in town if they want to spend their time in town and for traveling expenses
        and so on. But generally, people of the kibbutz as I said do not have money
        because they don’t need any money; they have all their necessities supplied
        by the kibbutz.

      u: There is no such thing as “parasite” because, as I said there is no law and
        order but there is a public opinion in the kibbutz which would not let a member
        sit in doing nothing. The moment he spends a day...he wastes a day...nobody
        will tell him a word, nobody will say anything. Certainly if he says “I don’t
        want to go out to work”—public opinion would be so...I would say...depressing
        upon him, pressing upon him, that he will not be able to stay in the kibbutz
        more...to stay in the kibbutz more than a day or two and leave it if he wants
        to be a parasite. But as I said members who prove their attachment to the
        kibbutz after a year of trial would remain in such a kibbutz if not, they
        would leave of their own will.

        I know that for instance when civil-service employees are allowed thirty days
        leave and thirty days for sickness they manage to be sick those thirty days
        in the year. [laughing]

      start: '01:06:24.057'
      end: '01:07:53.841'
      u: Oh, well, no such thing would be in the kibbutz as I said, public opinion
        and collective spirits of the people...because if a man doesn’t want to work
        his place is to go perhaps to in town—to town. Public opinion would not allow
        a member—and as I said only public opinion—there’s no such thing as rule,
        there’s no such thing as thing as punishment, no such thing as fine and there’s
        no such thing as requesting openly from a member to do his job. Public opinion
        is the ruling power and I would say, the moving spirit of the whole running
        of the kibbutz. And a member would not be able to see around him working men
        while he does nothing. He will have to do a job. If he is sick then it is
        the duty of the kibbutz to take care of him, even if he is sick for more than
        a month or two months. I know members who stayed in a kibbutz two years and
        they unfortunately became ill, they got TB as a...from some...result or another
        and they are being taken care of for years without doing any work. The kibbutz
        pays thousands of pounds a month for members to be cured in some resort or
        some other place; in Palestine or outside. I know even of members who have

        who stayed in the kibbutz only two or three months but who proved their desire

        a population of say three hundred or four hundred...sure enough you are right

        in Palestine since 19...I would say 1908. It’s over—it’s about forty years.
        I don’t know of any case of stealing in a settlement. I don’t know there is

        not be in the kibbutz the same way as if a member would steal “strength”—would
        not work—it’s also a way of stealing. If he still has energy and sits in the
        dining hall and eats and drinks and sleeps and doesn’t work he wouldn’t be

        are not always to be understood so swiftly and directly. If the British have
        some interest in Palestine they would—in order to carry out such interest,
        in order to come to the object of what they have they would recruit people
        who they think would serve their own purpose better. You ask “why don’t they
        recruit Jews—the Jewish people in Palestine—for that purpose?” The question
        is what is the purpose? At wartime when there was the war they tried to recruit
        as many Jews as they were able to—to put them to the front. And many, many
        Jews—over thirty-five thousand Jews joined the British Army and fought in
        all fields—in Europe, in North Africa, Syria and other places. Now, if the
        British authorities try to recruit men—it means to, they think, to keep order
        in the Middle East and they would certainly like to have British people more
        than Jewish people from Palestine.

      u: The word haganah itself means defense—self defense. The Jews in Palestine,
        as I’ve said before—after having experienced so many atrocities all over the
        world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of
        their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any...instigation
        on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves
        into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every
        Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly
        not aggressive—it has never been aggressive—they have proved their...the right
        of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried
        to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others
        by force—whether it’s land, whether it’s property, whether it’s any other
        right or ownership. What the thing is...the idea is to keep whatever they
        have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have
        seen in so many—so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been
        appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as
        a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish
        the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The
        haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the
        haganah a ‘terrorist organization.’ It’s true, there are some...there are
        two organizations who would be...would consider themselves...terrorists in
        the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property.
        These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically
        were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over...what has passed
        from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families
        and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience...experiencing
        so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone
        over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have
        also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property
        of the British. They are not in the sense of—there are differences even between
        themselves—but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority.
        And the Jewish institutions openly and sincerely oppose to such and undisciplined,
        and I would say unwise, acts being carried out by these young men.

      u: I as a Jew consider that there is ample opportunity and possibility of having
        peace in Palestine—only and...only if the Jews are given the right to come
        to Palestine. I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid
        of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it’s being tried to be...as people
        try to show it. It’s true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider
        it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience
        till now we know that the more the Jews—the more Jews arrive in Palestine
        the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically—and not only economically—socially,
        politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told.
        Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was
        the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and
        Palestine originated...[?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations.
        It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American
        Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that “no Jew has any
        right to this country called Palestine” is, I would say, a mistake and a historical
        mistake. The Jews say that they cannot—they will never displace any Arabs
        from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right
        to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of
        the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that
        would let both people live peacefully...each at the side of the other.

      u: They have...certainly. Palestine is a neglected country. It has been neglected
        for the last few hundred years. History shows us that Palestine used to be
        a most...one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions
        of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work,
        and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who
        have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected
        land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the
        land of the country. So you have another 96...94%. Out of that you have some
        land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the
        Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely
        neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the
        Negev—the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they
        hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there,
        they have already a few stations there—kind of an experimenting station...where
        they try to find water by all means—scientific means—in their hands. And they
        have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine
        near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought
        of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are
        gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times
        of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited. What
        we want is to inhabit those neglected settlements again without affecting
        in any way the people who are already in Palestine.

        taken time out simply because I couldn’t get any DPs this morning and between
        going and looking at Wiesbaden or enjoying the sights [around?] Wiesbaden
        I preferred to spend the morning with you and I appreciate you giving me your
        time. [Golen says something off-mic]

      u: Yes, all right, let’s have that. There was still one more point—it’s like
        a rolling snowball—one question brings up the other one again and again. We
        are coming now to the religious question in Palestine and I’m going to take
        advantage of it. Here it is. Take the microphone and take your time.

      end: '01:27:18.683'
      u: Well, I thought that this question—the question of religion—would interest
        you and I would like to touch on it very shortly, I would say. “A:” you have,
        many people have asked, “how is religion being...what shall I say—how is that
        existing in, first of all, in the certain settlements?” People thought that
        the settlements are irreligious or anti-religious or whatever they called
        them...

      end: '01:27:34.616'
      u: Or fanatical religious, [no?]. Well I know that religion, as any other view
        or way of thought, is liberally practiced in Palestine. Is liberally practiced
        also in these very settlements. “A:”...

      u: By liberally you mean “religious tolerance” or “a great deal of religion?”
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:27:38.867'
      end: '01:28:02.877'
      u: Well, I mean religious tolerance and a great deal of religion in certain
        settlements. You have settlements where all the group is religious that means
        Jews who belong to the party of the Mizrachi and who also adopted the idea
        of collectivism—of having a settlement and running their lives in the same
        way and form as the other settlements.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '01:28:02.877'

      u: Pardon my ignorance.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:28:08.529'
      end: '01:29:15.466'
      u: Mizrachi is one of the political parties of the Zionist organization—of the
        Jewish Agency, if you want to say. It’s rather the Zionist organization—there
        are Jews all over the world—religious Jews who could consider that they have
        to combine work and religion in the...with the view of “up-building” the country—of
        Palestine. And these younger boys of the Mizrachi have established settlements—religious
        settlements—that means where they can practice their religion and they can
        carry on with their work without any body interrupting them. When I say without
        any body interrupting them it doesn’t mean in other settlements religion is
        being interrupted. On the contrary—in every settlement, practically every
        settlement, you have a shul—a synagogue—where all the parents go to pray and
        where the younger people whoever want, can go and pray. Religion is being
        taught in schools—in the settlements—Bible and other Jewish, religious...learning.
        But it is free, nobody would force you to be religious but nobody would be
        sad you [can’t be?] religious.

      u: They would not allow you to smoke openly. It will...in the settlement you
        ask?
    - who: David Boder

      u: Yes.
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:29:25.015'
      end: '01:30:16.521'
      u: The same as you would do in any place of Palestine or any other place in
        the world. Any person who is not religious is allowed to do whatever he likes
        but on one condition—not to rouse—not to rise any bad feelings on another
        person. That means not to cause a religious person any suffering. No [?],
        what you call—no “open smoking” should be practiced where there are religious
        Jews. And in the religious settlements, certainly, there is no question of
        smoking on Saturday because they keep Sabbath fully and to the last point.
        But even in town Jews...I can’t say that the Jews wouldn’t smoke on Shabbat—they
        will smoke on Shabbat but they would see to it that none smoke it or rather
        that religious Jews should not see it.
    - who: David Boder
      start: '01:30:16.521'
      end: '01:30:27.237'
      u: Well, wouldn’t you consider that it’s about time to start a movement of tolerance
        and teach those Jews to respect the religious views of other Jews?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:30:27.237'
      end: '01:31:11.661'
      u: No doubt about that. I think that Palestine in this respect has shown a great
        deal of tolerance. On the one part the religious Jews understand that they
        cannot make every Jew religious by force, they are trying to preach—to induce
        opportunity to be more religious, but they don’t use force. There is a small
        force of younger, fanatic religious Jews who try to interrupt the traffic
        on the eve of Shabbat but they are really a very negligible part of the whole
        and really can’t be taken into consideration. In general, as far as I can
        say from my own experience, tolerance is one of the main...I would say...characteristics
        of Palestine. I don’t want to...

        things. I...Do you have liberal synagogues in Palestine?
    - who: Judah Golen
      start: '01:31:21.471'
      end: '01:31:55.245'
      u: We have no synagogues [?] because liberal synagogues are mainly in the United
        States and not many liberal Jews went over from the States to Palestine to
        establish a liberal synagogue. I know of one person—Rabbi Wilhelm who is a
        liberal Jew and he conducts a certain liberal synagogue in Jerusalem but I
        cannot say that the people are many people...the members of this liberal shul
        because they originate mainly—the Jews mainly—from Poland, Russia and other
        countries where no liberal Jews are in existence...

        a synagogue tolerated?

      start: '01:32:10.052'

      u: Yes, I understand...many Jews from America would come over to Palestine and
        establish a liberal shul I am more than certain that nobody would say—would
        tell them “don’t do that”—the same way as they don’t do it in America.
    - who: David Boder

      u: Now will you please tell me a few words about those [?] I met in France.
        [?] Russians, who have joined the Jewish faith not for the sake of marriage
        but out of religious conviction. Are there many in Palestine and how are they
        being treated?
    - who: Judah Golen

      end: '01:33:09.486'
      u: I’m sorry I really I cannot tell you very much on that subject. I know of
        a number of Russian Christians who came to—migrated to Palestine after having
        been converted into Jewish—into Jewish religion in Russia. As you said out
        of their own conviction, nobody forced them, nobody asked them, because for
        a Christian to become a Jew it’s much more difficult than vice versa.

      u: In the way that...the Jew would not encourage a Christian to become a Jew—they
        would say as long as you are in your own creed, keep your own creed. But if
        this Christian would insist and would prove himself, very convinced that the
        Jewish religion is his—should be his religion—the Rabbi would help him to
        become a Jew. But there would never be a movement encouraging or trying...

        been converted into Judaism out of their own will. I cannot speak much about
        it because they are not very well known in Palestine—they are very few—I know
        of very few in the settlements even and they are members as any other member—they
        speak Hebrew and you cannot distinguish between them and the other Jewish
        in the settlement. I am...for me it’s rather new to see—to hear—it that you

        over to Germany with the object of going to Palestine they took with them
        their wives who are Russian Christians but who have attached themselves to

      u: Germany, Wiesbaden, September the 26th. I think I marked yesterday the records
        “the 26th” so I will have to make a correction. I am really overstaying my
        time [intelligible?] and they can’t send me one anyway before...eight o’clock
        tonight. I am...it is Rosh Hashanah and the Jewish community is in the synagogue—the
        synagogue which I’ve been told has not yet been officially dedicated but has
        of course Rosh Hashanah services in...after the chaplain has said...what’s
        the chaplain’s name?

      u: ". . . as Chaplain Darling from the United States Army, Chaplain Darling
        has said, it’s after seven years the first Rosh Hashanah service in the synagogue.
        I am taking time out. I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services
        later but I’m taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a
        representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,—for Palestine—and since
        I have met a number of these men and women...often in Italy and France on
        railroad trains and so on...I have decided to take out this morning out and
        he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives
        of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred
        people working in the various DP camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind
        first of all to tell who you are and then let’s go on with the story. The
        microphone is yours for as much time as you want."

        of parents who were born in Palestine—and the grandson of grandfather and
        grandmother who were born in Palestine. I had my education in Palestine and
        in Great Britain—in England. I am an advocate by profession...

        department of the Jewish Agency. I have volunteered a few months ago to go
        to Europe and see what one can do for the remnants of the Jews who are still
        in Europe. My object is really to be in Austria and establish there the connections,
        and the machinery, for dealing with the Jews who are there and who are passing
        from Eastern Europe to the Western side with an idea to come later to Palestine."

        of all a Palestine office. The...I’m going to have a small mission of some
        fifteen men and women from Palestine who would be spread all over Austria
        to the various camps—in the various camps—and do first of all the cultural
        and instructive work among the DPs. The, um, to tell you how the whole thing
        started it would be a rather a long story but the first...Jews who arrived
        in Europe during the war and immediately after...victory were the Jews from
        Palestine who served in the Jewish brigades which is now known all over the
        world. They were the first who reached the remnants of our brothers and succeeded
        in getting to a far point in—within Russia itself. They then organized and
        helped those Jews to come over to the Allies and...rather Western side of
        Europe. Would you stop the...

      u: Now, uh, after the Jewish brigade had to leave Europe and go back to Palestine
        for demobilization the Jewish Agency for Palestine decided to send a number
        of Jewish shluchim which called really “messengers” from Palestine to the
        Jews in Europe. The Jewish Agency has contacted the UNRRA...UNRRA authorities
        who are very sympathetic and who assisted in having a number of Jews from
        Palestine come over to Europe. The JAFP—which means the Jewish agency for
        Palestine is now in Europe—in Germany—as a separate unit attached to the UNRRA.
        There are now about a hundred of such men and women doing work in the various
        camps, among the DPs in conjunction with UNRRA.

      u: Well, the Jewish agency pays their expenses as to if a man has to get his
        salary for example, he is paid by the Jewish agency. On the other hand the
        UNRRA keeps the men in Germany and covers, as many other members of the UNRRA,
        their economic and traveling expenses. I wouldn’t say all traveling expenses—a
        major part is being paid by the Jewish Agency. But various facilities are
        sympathetically given by the UNRRA....another question?

        there with UNRRA authorities in Vienna and Austria so that we can establish
        a unit of the Jewish Agency in Austria. “What are these men and women from
        Palestine doing in the camp?” First of all, one should realize the mental
        and physical situation of the Jews who arrived a few months ago from Poland
        and who are coming here with strong stream from Poland and even Russia.

        you have...I mean...there’s a man or who is coming to a DP camp is a member
        of an UNRRA team and his duty is to do for these DPs whatever the UNRRA would
        tell him. But as there are Jews from Palestine, they have the ability and
        possibility to deal in more cultural work for the Jews in the DP. They are
        also serving as instructors in various—I would say—in vocational work. We
        have organized in various...around some camps in Germany kind of...groups
        of youth—Jewish youth, who are taking agricultural and other training. We

        and all over the world. The connection between the Jewish Agency and the AJDC
        in Europe is rather strong and as far as I could see from the last two or
        three weeks I have been in Munich—in Munich, in Germany—the relations are
        very good. I have met a great number of AJDC men and ORT men and I see that
        in one respect, in respect of helping the brothers—all our own brothers—the
        men on the [spot?] have understood that is one thing and that is harmony among
        the workers so that the Jews who are here should only gain by the presence
        of such an organization. Now...

        too many different agencies do the same thing. Just to say personally I want
        to say right now that I don’t agree with that. What do you think?

      u: Well I associate myself with your view. I don’t think there is duplication.
        ‘A:’ I consider that there is a lack of men all over....of Jews from more
        liberated countries like America, Palestine, France, England who can do a
        great deal for those people who are in the DPs. But as to the question of
        duplication I don’t consider that duplication. What we, the Jewish Agency,
        is doing now is “A:”...the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language
        is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do
        not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the
        people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with
        the aid of the AJDC—the teachers come from Palestine. Some money and other
        help is being given by the other institutions. The Hebrew language is being
        taught to the children and other subjects are being taught in Hebrew.

        being organized among the Jewish population who count now about 650,000 in
        Palestine and I know practically every Jew in Palestine has been contributing
        to these various Jewish institutions whose object is also—I mean who includes
        in that program helping the Jews in the Diaspora. I know that during the war
        the first, I would say, the first who succeeded in sending over help in money
        and in other ways—I mean in clothing and books and so on to Europe, to the
        people who were still in the...under the enemy regime, were the Palestinians.
        But I would not say that they did it themselves. It’s known and I know it
        from my own personal knowledge that the AJDC...helped a great deal. I mean
        they really supplied the money and the Jews of Palestine found a way to send
        it over, with their own money collected from Palestine, to the ghetto in Warsaw...to
        Poland and to other places in Europe when the Germans were still there.

        by the AJDC is greatly appreciated and it should continue. What I can say
        is more about the JAFP which is as I said a separate unit in the UNRRA—within
        the UNRRA. Now...as I said there are hundreds already in Pales—Germany, both
        zones, British and American. As far as I know the UNRRA are very, very satisfied
        with these men because...mentally they know how to approach DPs. And the DPs
        whose aim throughout the war and before the war and now, was Palestine, which
        they considered the only...as I said at the time -wartime- the only thing
        which remained for them was to go to Palestine. They would take a Jew from
        Palestine more into their confidence than any other person. Also the question
        of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew
        from Poland whether it’s Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised
        to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries
        in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew—speak fluent Hebrew—which is again
        a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine. Would you like
        to know anything?"

      u: Well I’ll you exactly how it is—I’ll tell you. Immediately after the war
        and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews
        in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some
        energy to...stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has
        been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties—we
        cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and
        outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not
        bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But...and these difficulties naturally
        caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those
        elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and
        they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after
        seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some
        peace—peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where
        they have relatives there, people move for America—especially the United States—I...and
        people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from—and
        you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that
        all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who
        have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter
        a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large.
        Neither America, although America has shown a great—what should I say—great
        generosity...I can’t...whether this is the word...towards accepting Jews into
        their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter
        of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German
        zones—not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland.

        the next few weeks the British government will realize the difficulty which
        is caused to the various Jews in Europe, Jews in Palestine and the Jews all
        over the world, and will increase the figure to a height which would at least
        satisfy, in some respect, the amount—great amount—of the Jews asked to come
        into Palestine. I do not want to go into more wider political issues on this
        point...

        What I would like to say is this: that the words—that the works—of the various Jews who are coming to Europe and who are spread all over the...camps in the DP area—the DP camps—is, as far as I could see, is greatly appreciated by both the American authorities, the British authorities—I wouldn’t say by both—by the various institutions—the UNRRA, the other Jewish institutions, and the main thing it is mostly appreciated by the Jews themselves in the DPs. It’s really encouraging to see, when one comes into a DP camp, to see the various children sitting in school—in schools, being taught by a Palestinian teacher Hebrew and other subjects in Hebrew. This question of education should really be stressed and more than stressed. Boys who for over six months had no learning at all; whatever they learned when they were let’s say six, seven years old or even ten years old they must have forgotten and for six years they have not seen a book, they have not planned to read, they have not progressed in teaching—in learning. These boys—you can see boys of fifteen, sixteen, who are starting now to learn the alphabet—the ABC’s. And they are doing it very enthusiastically and energetically and the hope is that in about a year or so the loss of time that these people have undergone will be regained by more...by industrials and energetic learning. In addition to teaching the...as I said, the various...teaching bible and teaching other subjects I say there is organized (in conjunction with the ORT and AJDC) various...they call it in Hebrew kibbutzei

        They don’t have it in Russia because the Jewish Agency has not been able to establish direct connections with the Russian government till now. If you ask me why, I can’t tell you. Better ask the Russians for this purpose. But we have it in Sweden, we have it in Germany now, in Munich, we have it in other towns around the American zone. Where there is the Palestinian office—a Palestinian office—who do the examining work, who should get a certificate, and who is...who should be able to proceed to Palestine immediately under those certificates. As I said, unfortunately, the number of certificates is so small that it’s become rather...the certificate is less important than anything because of its...the difficulty of getting it...because of its non-existence, I would say. The Palestinian offices have now almost no work to do. But the Jewish Agency is establishing these Palestinian offices with the hope that certificates would be granted—in a greater number—and then the work would start again. “What are the Palestinian offices doing exactly and how do they give the certificates?” There are various categories: “A:” there are relatives in Palestine like fathers who have their sons in Europe or husbands who have left their wives in Europe—these have the priority. Again, you have sons who have their parents, sisters who have their brothers—these have, again, the priority. After that comes the efficiency of the man.

Again you have, before the war we had also a category of “capitalists.” That we, as Jews who owned over a thousand pounds, were allowed to be given—were allowed to come to Palestine under such certificate. These were also distributed in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. But government itself—British government—could also give certificates for people without even consulting the Jewish Agency (as to this question of these capitalists).

      u: 'Wiesbaden September the 26th, this is DP Boder speaking and I usually don’t
        identify the spool that way but it’s my last day in Germany. It is Rosh Hashanah.
        The Jewish community, maintained by the UNRRA, is having its first Rosh Hashanah
        services which they are rebuilding with their own hands. And which has been
        seven years ago, according to Capt. and Chaplain Darling, desecrated. But
        I am taking advantage of the morning to get some additional material although
        I would like to record at least a part of the services which I still may do.
        My interviewee is Mr. Golen a Palestinian-born, a third generation Palestinian,
        who is working with the Jewish Agency for Palestine here. We have covered
        all of spool 160 and I am going over now to spool 161. Illinois Institute
        of Technology wire-recording in the general study of displaced people in Europe
        without distinction of race or creed. Also, I want to ask you a question about
        the kibbutz...kibbutz.hachshara. I was in Italy...they have there self-government.
        I saw in one room 36 young people. Men and women together, well that is common
        for all UNRRA camps. They let the Mennonites who seem to be the best organized
        live men, women, and children together in one barrack. It is not particular
        to the Jews but it seems to have been...and it is not on their fault, so to
        say, but let me ask you this question...Now let’s come back and take that
        what hurts us most: thirty-six young people in one room. Married couples when
        they are without children also in that same room. Sometimes the cots moved
        together, sometimes two people in one cot. Of course it’s all better than
        it was in the German concentration camp but “what do you think is the influence
        and the significance of such life?” “And what can be done in general about
        it?”'

        it is a collective settlement. They have there common room where they have
        their meetings together—you cannot have a meeting separately—where they eat

        If they are married they have—these young couples—have their room or two rooms
        sometimes if the kibbutz has economic or financial possibilities to supply
        that. There is no such thing as living families in the same room together.
        No human being likes that—it’s against human nature—and these young boys and
        girls if they do conduct a life together in—as you saw, said you saw in Italy—I
        can assure you, even without my having been there, that it’s out of difficulty
        to sheer necessity to get separate rooms. The idea of the kibbutz, of the
        collective...life in the collective form, is not—is not to eliminate and forget
        the individual element. Not to...merge your individuality into the collective.
        It’s to give to the collective whatever you can give and take from it whatever

        of labor and, for example, instead of every mother having the necessity to
        give her—all her time to her child they have collected the children into separate
        children houses where a few mothers are able to give the whole day work to
        the children while the other mothers can go out to the field or can do other
        work for the kibbutz."

        comes home and if he still has, even though let’s say if the woman works—if
        the woman has to prepare food and to do other things, she has no time to give

        house to sleep and say goodbye—goodnight—to their father. In the morning the

        he is not able to speak to his son while in the kibbutz the work is so divided

        many of them started as members of the kibbutzim. Then they decided to run

        of the kibbutz has learned in the art of somewhere watch-making, repairs it
        for him. Can one pay to the other privately for it?"

      u: No. There’s no such thing as money as I said and members do not have money.
        But, if a member has a watch and he has to repair it, the kibbutz will pay
        for repairing that watch either in town or in the kibbutz. That means if a
        man knows the work of watch-repairing or watch-making in the kibbutz, he will
        not be paid, it will be his profession and he gets for the work he does his
        food and his clothing and his health service and he’s being taken care of
        by the various people around—he should have been taken care of—for that he
        gives his work, whatever he can do whether its watch-making or whether its
        another way. He will not pay his friend. “A:” his friend will not ask for
        money, “B:” the kibbutz is responsible to the watch to run smoothly and they
        will pay for the repairing expenses.

        a whole is paid with the outside market—if they sell their goods or their
        food, they get money. For this money the committee buys things for the members
        of the kibbutz. And they get it directly without having money pass through
        the hands of each individual. There is no need for money because you can do
        nothing for money. If he goes to town, he is being given an amount sufficient
        to...have him...to make him able to spend a fortnight or three weeks in town.
        Usually members of the kibbutz have their leave once a year for a fortnight
        or three weeks...

        and collective spirits of the people...because if a man doesn’t want to work
        his place is to go perhaps to in town—to town. Public opinion would not allow
        a member—and as I said only public opinion—there’s no such thing as rule,
        there’s no such thing as thing as punishment, no such thing as fine and there’s
        no such thing as requesting openly from a member to do his job. Public opinion
        is the ruling power and I would say, the moving spirit of the whole running
        of the kibbutz. And a member would not be able to see around him working men
        while he does nothing. He will have to do a job. If he is sick then it is
        the duty of the kibbutz to take care of him, even if he is sick for more than
        a month or two months. I know members who stayed in a kibbutz two years and
        they unfortunately became ill, they got TB as a...from some...result or another
        and they are being taken care of for years without doing any work. The kibbutz
        pays thousands of pounds a month for members to be cured in some resort or
        some other place; in Palestine or outside. I know even of members who have
        been sent to Switzerland to be cured at the expense of the kibbutz. Members
        who stayed in the kibbutz only two or three months but who proved their desire
        to work in the kibbutz and the kibbutz feels it’s a duty to take care of its
        members.

        are not always to be understood so swiftly and directly. If the British have
        some interest in Palestine they would—in order to carry out such interest,
        in order to come to the object of what they have they would recruit people
        who they think would serve their own purpose better. You ask “why don’t they
        recruit Jews—the Jewish people in Palestine—for that purpose?” The question
        is what is the purpose? At wartime when there was the war they tried to recruit
        as many Jews as they were able to—to put them to the front. And many, many
        Jews—over thirty-five thousand Jews joined the British Army and fought in
        all fields—in Europe, in North Africa, Syria and other places. Now, if the
        British authorities try to recruit men—it means to, they think, to keep order
        in the Middle East and they would certainly like to have British people more
        than Jewish people from Palestine.

      u: The word haganah itself means defense—self defense. The Jews in Palestine,
        as I’ve said before—after having experienced so many atrocities all over the
        world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of
        their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any...instigation
        on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves
        into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every
        Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly
        not aggressive—it has never been aggressive—they have proved their...the right
        of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried
        to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others
        by force—whether it’s land, whether it’s property, whether it’s any other
        right or ownership. What the thing is...the idea is to keep whatever they
        have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have
        seen in so many—so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been
        appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as
        a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish
        the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The
        haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the
        haganah a ‘terrorist organization.’ It’s true, there are some...there are
        two organizations who would be...would consider themselves...terrorists in
        the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property.
        These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically
        were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over...what has passed
        from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families
        and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience...experiencing
        so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone
        over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have
        also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property
        of the British. They are not in the sense of—there are differences even between
        themselves—but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority.
        And the Jewish institutions openly and sincerely oppose to such and undisciplined,
        and I would say unwise, acts being carried out by these young men.

      u: I as a Jew consider that there is ample opportunity and possibility of having
        peace in Palestine—only and...only if the Jews are given the right to come
        to Palestine. I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid
        of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it’s being tried to be...as people
        try to show it. It’s true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider
        it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience
        till now we know that the more the Jews—the more Jews arrive in Palestine
        the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically—and not only economically—socially,
        politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told.
        Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was
        the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and
        Palestine originated...[?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations.
        It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American
        Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that “no Jew has any
        right to this country called Palestine” is, I would say, a mistake and a historical
        mistake. The Jews say that they cannot—they will never displace any Arabs
        from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right
        to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of
        the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that
        would let both people live peacefully...each at the side of the other.

      u: They have...certainly. Palestine is a neglected country. It has been neglected
        for the last few hundred years. History shows us that Palestine used to be
        a most...one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions
        of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work,
        and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who
        have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected
        land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the
        land of the country. So you have another 96...94%. Out of that you have some
        land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the
        Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely
        neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the
        Negev—the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they
        hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there,
        they have already a few stations there—kind of an experimenting station...where
        they try to find water by all means—scientific means—in their hands. And they
        have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine
        near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought
        of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are
        gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times
        of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited. What
        we want is to inhabit those neglected settlements again without affecting
        in any way the people who are already in Palestine.

        are Jews all over the world—religious Jews who could consider that they have
        to combine work and religion in the...with the view of “up-building” the country—of
        Palestine. And these younger boys of the Mizrachi have established settlements—religious
        settlements—that means where they can practice their religion and they can
        carry on with their work without any body interrupting them. When I say without
        any body interrupting them it doesn’t mean in other settlements religion is
        being interrupted. On the contrary—in every settlement, practically every
        settlement, you have a shul—a synagogue—where all the parents go to pray and
        where the younger people whoever want, can go and pray. Religion is being
        taught in schools—in the settlements—Bible and other Jewish, religious...learning.

        but on one condition—not to rouse—not to rise any bad feelings on another
        person. That means not to cause a religious person any suffering. No [?],
        what you call—no “open smoking” should be practiced where there are religious
        Jews. And in the religious settlements, certainly, there is no question of
        smoking on Saturday because they keep Sabbath fully and to the last point.
        But even in town Jews...I can’t say that the Jews wouldn’t smoke on Shabbat—they
        will smoke on Shabbat but they would see to it that none smoke it or rather
        that religious Jews should not see it.

        cannot make every Jew religious by force, they are trying to preach—to induce
        opportunity to be more religious, but they don’t use force. There is a small
        force of younger, fanatic religious Jews who try to interrupt the traffic
        on the eve of Shabbat but they are really a very negligible part of the whole
        and really can’t be taken into consideration. In general, as far as I can

      u: I see. It’s interesting to know. I know of one thing I met, near Munich,
        in Funkenkaserne it’s a kind of a transit camp...

      u: ". . . transit camp, some Russian women. They are not Jews but they met Jews
        in the Russian Army and they got married and became Jews and its interesting
        that these Jews in the Russian army still kept their faith and connection
        with Jews and now when they have the possibility to leave Russia and come
        over to Germany with the object of going to Palestine they took with them
        their wives who are Russian Christians but who have attached themselves to
        their husbands and they would like to share their faith in Palestine as well.
        These are very few..."

      u: Well, this finally concludes the interview of two-and-a-half spools with
        Mr. Judah Golen. Pardon...in Wiesbaden, September the 26th, 1946. We are concluding
        this at seventeen minute indicator of the spool. We have spent with Mr. Golen
        a good two hours; we have taken ninety-five maybe hundred minutes of recording.
        I appreciate his patience; I have learned a great deal. Illinois Institute
        of Technology wire-recording.

      u: This is Spool 9-12B, the second part of Spool 12. Taken in Paris at Chateau
        Boucicout, among the Buchenwald children. It starts with a rather unharmonius
        singing, but the melody can probably be recognized and the words eventually
        translated, if that hasn’t been done. The interviewee is Kalman Eisenberg,
        who later sings the solo song.

      u: As soon as the Germans entered our town we left immediately for another town,
        a small town in which very few people lived. Since our town was a manufacturing
        city with large factories, people were very scared. And a week’s time, two
        weeks later when the German was already [there], we could not make a go of
        it in that small town so that we had to return to the [our] town. Soon during
        the journey we were stopped by Germans and searched. The little property [belongings]
        that we had was taken away from us on the road and distributed among the Poles,
        the Gentiles. And afterwards, when we came back to the town, we did not find
        anthing in the house any more. Everything had been taken out, and everything
        had been robbed by other neighbors. And in the town there were very few people.
        Soon on the next day, it was on ‘Yom Kipper,’ coming out next morning, the
        synagogue was already no more. We saw already it is in flames. That old synagogue
        that had been standing for years and years was lit up in flames. In the middle
        of the night, in the middle of the night on the second day, the synagogue
        was still burning. As propaganda, people had to take the rabbi and sign that
        the synagogue had been set on fire by ourselves. And we had to save [fight
        the fire] by ourselves. And who...and whoever came out to [try and] save the
        synagogue, they were beaten with terrible beatings, and also a few people
        were shot. And later on, when there had already passed a long, quite a long
        time, they were then...the Jews were then separated from the... from the Poles.
        The Jews had to live then in special houses on special streets where no Pole
        was allowed to enter. And soon there began very hard living conditions. And
        afterwards, after quite a long time, there was...there was...there was...issued
        an order from the German authorities that all Jews have to wear the bands.
        And [he] who does not have a band on his arm, he receives ‘ten years’ punishment,
        or else be shot [?] on the spot. Many cases happened when a Jew in that crowded
        ghetto, where he was living and could not sustain himself and his family,
        was forced to go out on the...on the forbidden streets. And many times it
        happened that Jews out of luck were shot, and half a year later an order came
        out that everyone from eighteen to forty-five has to report to the Jewish
        council...council. The next day at eight o’clock in the morning all the Jews
        in the town reported and [were] led out to a square, guarded by Germans, and
        there we stood without eating or drinking a whole day. In the evening, herded
        like cattle into RR-cars and shipped away. Many people, one may say...report
        that fifty per cent remained there in the lager...

        father I did not have. The mother, to earn for bread she could not, because
        she had to stay only on the streets that had been assigned. And on the other
        streets where the Christians, the Gentiles, were living we could not go out
        on any more, and so it was very hard, that life. Returning home at night,
        sometimes I would find a potato without salt, and sometimes there was not
        even that. And early in the morning, again with the same hunger, return to
        the same work that a hundred per cent...fifty per cent, one can say, I did
        not expect to return, because [one was] without strength and getting beaten
        very much. All of a sudden Jews from all over begin to arrive in our town.
        There begins a traffic with autos, with trains. From all over Jews begin arriving.
        And so what is going on? There is a bustle in the town. People are being resettled.
        People are being resettled from all the towns to Treblinka from where people
        do not return any more, the death lager which is known all over the world,
        Treblinka. We are thinking about a way out, but there is no way out. Thus
        it was going on for two weeks. One bright...bright morning a five o’clock,
        the whole town is guarded, surrounded, and an order was given that in ten
        minutes not one Jewish child [son or daughter of Israel] is to be found in
        his home. And many Jews...and many Jews were prepared for it. We slept with
        the clothes on. [He used the word Ungetuigs for clothes which was not understood
        by the interviewer.]

      u: The whole family went out. The whole family came out of the house. There
        were already Germans waiting with grenades, with machine guns in the hands
        and looked for the moment to kill us. But we had...but we were following the
        order, and it did not last...did not take ten minutes to come out. Coming
        out on the street, I once more...I, myself, looked back once again at my house,
        and I said, ‘This house I will not see again.’ We went out to the market place.
        This is a large square in the center of town. All the Jews were assembled
        there. Walking, we already saw how Jewish blood flows in the streets, and
        the bullets are flying. When we were already assembled on the square, we see
        an old couple walking. They have no more strength to drag their feet. So a
        German takes and leads [them] into a house and with one bullet he shot both
        of them. Put one next to the other, both heads, and shot both. Going ahead,
        looking around the town again, we see the children lost from their mothers
        and mothers lost from their children. They are calling, the mothers to the
        children and the children to the mothers. But those children whom the Germans
        had noticed, who had from great fright lost their mothers, died immediately
        on the spot. Such a panic lasted four, five hours. It was terrible. Also while
        standing in rows, the Germans came over and took off immediately everything,
        the better things. I myself was dressed in my best suit, my best clothes.
        They soon took off my jacket and my boots, and they asked if I do not have
        any money or anything else.

        were already standing arranged in fours...and [I] heard the last words of
        my mother, how she said to me, ‘No! You are going with us. Whatever will happen
        to us will happen to you, too.’ At a short distance passed an SS man, and
        [he] immediately took off my jacket and a pair of boots. I remained barefooted.
        Luckily I had in my bundle a pair of old shoes that I had taken along. I put
        [them] on and stood dismayed, mornful, seeing what is happening to Jews. How
        the blood flows, and the little children taken by the feet and thrown against
        the wall. And later on when the afternoon came, everybody was tired standing
        on that square. There suddenly arrived an auto with five SS men. And they
        said for all young men from eighteen to twenty-five to fall in, to be taken
        to work. I was a boy of fourteen years. I did not have the chance to step
        forward. But suddenly an SS man was passing, and he took a liking to me. He
        gave me a sign with his revolver, and I had to step our from the ranks, and
        with a heavy...with an embittered heart I looked at the mother and left the
        ranks, [and was] incorporated into the ranks of the workers. Once more I wanted
        to turn and take a look at my mother. I soon got [it] with a riding crop over
        the head that to this day I still have a souvenir of that instant.

        take revenge for our blood, innocent blood that is being spilled innocently
        by the barbaric, murderous hands.’ And with that, with such an embittered
        heart, did I go out from the ranks. Arriving in the new lager, we were spread
        out in two places. We separately, and the women, very few, separately. When
        we where standing on that square an order came to hand over whatever we still
        had. All our things on one side and the rest that we have, to throw away.
        We went over to the other side. The things we left on the place on which we
        were formerly...standing before. And later on there arrived a few SS men and
        gave an order, ‘In the name of our Fuehrer ten people will be shoot.’ And

        the Temple]. So it looked. Everybody was thinking about what had happened
        to the parents and to the other people who had remained there on that square.
        In such...in such a mood [?] we sat till the evening. The night fell slowly.
        It fell gradually, and everybody on the plank beds, bewildered, confused,
        brooding. There was no question of sleeping. The desire to sleep came to nobody’s
        mind. I, as a young boy, sit and cry and complain. With whon did I remain?
        And what will I do? And what will the future be? Lost. There is no hope. I
        myself must summon courage that I should be able to live through that moment
        and be able to relate to the Jews all over, in every corner or the world,
        in each of the four corners of the world, what has happened to the...to us.
        The story, the times we have gone through. In the middle of the night everyone
        sits exhausted, in thoughts. Suddenly we hear a shot. Indeed [?] a guard,
        a Ukrainian, got a fancy and shot [burst] into our barrack. And there fell
        two badly wounded and three dead.

        had found a mark, there would have been many more victims. But, thank God,
        it only cost three burned offerings and two wounded. And so, tacken aback
        by the dead and by the wounded, there was no councel or aid. We had no water.
        To go out was a threat of death. And so gradually with our own efforts we
        did whatever we could in order to alleviate their suffering, to reduce their
        plight. Dawn was nearing slowly. We all arose, and we wanted to go to work.
        We thought that if we remain lying they will take it for sabotage, that we
        do not want to go to work. So we all arose and went to work. [While the prisoners
        were] walking out through the door, the Ukrainians heard it. They immediately
        surrounded our barrack and fell upon us like murderers, with machine guns
        in the hands, and were beating with rubber truncheons. ‘What do you think,
        you Jew? You band of Jews, what do you think, you have any way out of this
        lager? Here you must remain! Here you must croak! And your life you must end
        in this lager’ And with terrible blows they chased...chased us back into the
        lager. By six o’clock in the morning there came in a Jew who was...who had
        been elected temporarily to take charge of the lager.

      u: The Germans. [Corrects himself:] The Ukrainians. The guards [authorities]
        of the lager made him so temporarily. And he came in...he came into the block,
        and he told us to get dressed and go to work. In five minutes everybody was
        ready, because nobody had slept, nobody had undressed. Everybody was depressed,
        crush-...crushed by his...by his misfortunes, by his pain. [We were] arranged
        on the square and went to work Going out through the gate we received the
        bread which we took along among our things. Everyone received a slice of around
        ten dekas, five dekas. It depended on how much luck one had. And a little
        bitter, cold, unsweetened coffee. That was the first day of our going out
        to work. When we arrived at work...[when we were] entering the factory, the
        Ukrainians received us with bad beatings [?]. We were assigned to sections
        in Polish, ‘Do wydzial’ [to work halls] where everyone was to work. We immediately
        got the worst kind of work. We, Jews children, were taken,of eighteen, or
        seventeen, of sixteen years, [and] assigned to ovens of two thousand degrees
        of heat. They made ammunition, cannon...shells for cannon. And who did not
        complete the ‘norm’ like one says in Polish, that means the number that he
        was supposed to make—that was two thousand to three thousand shells—had to
        stand sixteen hours. And if I did not finish in sixteen hours, he [I?] Had
        to remain for twenty-four hours. That is how it was going on every day, the
        day by day work. In a short time very, very many people had fallen who did
        not have the strength to endure all those things. When the...when the Russians
        had come closer, [when] they came near the Vistula, the Germans considered
        it a danger if we should remain in the place, and we have to be sent away
        to [the interior of] Germany. At night there came an order that not one Jew
        is to go to work but has to remain in the place, on that spot, in the lager.
        A terrible fright gripped the whole lager. Everybody walked around brooding
        and said, ‘Now [these] are our last moments. The Russians are approaching
        and the Germans knows that he has lost the war. He will finish us all off
        on the spot just where we are.’ Two three...two days this situation [?] lasted.

        in the morning till three in the afternoon can still go to work. It became
        a little easier, but still people were still going around with the same fright.
        [The continuity seems disrupted.] Arriving at work, the Gentiles, the Christians,
        told us the terrible agony that was experienced by the people who had remained
        there on the square. Because until now we had had no information, and later
        on we had some information from people who had returned...who were taken as
        far as Treblinka and after that they returned. And part of those people [possibly
        Christians] were also working there in the factory, who were driving the wagons,
        the engines from on factory to another. An acquaintance, a Jew, was acquainted
        with such a machinist, and he told him about the terrible tortures that the
        Jews, those people had suffered, who had been taken away. First of all, a
        hundred and fifty people were packed into a small RR-car. Entirely closed,
        nailed shut, doused with chloride [chlorek]. And the bundles taken away, and
        the water they needed. And chased inside [the RR-cars], beaten up, grabbed
        bloody, herded into the RR-cars. That Christian reported the impossible thing
        that fifty per cent would arrive half alive at that place. He said that he
        is completely convinced that not a single Jew will [could] arrive at that
        place alive, not withstanding that the place as such was the death sentence.
        That means Treblinka. Returning from work, we heard that the guards had searched
        the entire plant [to see] whether, God forbid, a Jew did not hide himself
        there and escape at night into the forest and hide himself.

        a decision was made by the Jews that from this lager we have to get away.
        Should we remain till next morning there are definite rumors that we will
        be shot. At night everyone was awake. No one slept. The police [apparently
        Jewish trusties] came into each barrack and said ‘Jews, the last moments of
        our lives are approaching, and so we have one way out, to break out of the
        lager. And not far from the lager there is a forest. It is quite certain that
        many Jews will fall but this cannot be helped. Who will remain alive...whoever
        will be able to save his life will remain alive. And if we shall do nothing,
        the entire lager will perish. There is no place where we could be taken. There
        is no place, and the Germans will not let us live. It is an impossible thing
        that they will let us live.’ At night, everything ready, a little bundle in
        the hand, with hammers, with pliers, with axes, [we] went over to the...eh...went
        over to the wires. There was no strong guard. And so on all four side Jews
        were standing and watched for the moment to be able to go over, tear out the
        fence and escape into the forest. Thus it lasted four, five, ten minutes.
        After that there came people running from all four sides and breaking the
        boards and cutting the wires. And a few people running from all four sides
        and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people succeeded
        in escaping. At the same moment fire began falling from all four roofs, from
        the towers where the guards stood, and many, many were shot and a very small
        part escaped into the woods. But the majority of Jews were afraid to risk
        [it] and did not have the possibilities any more of running over to the fence
        and running away, because death awaited them immediately.

        with the grenades, with arms in the hands. Finally we saw the dawn. So we

        to us, or they still had a figured-out moment [idea] that some people must
        remain, or they had yet another place to employ us. That is why, perhaps,
        they left us. One cannot know for sure why. Perhaps we were lucky, perhaps
        by a miracle, by accident. We do not know how, whether by accident, but we
        were driven on. And when...yes. Near Gleiwitz, having boarded the RR-cars,
        we drove in January in the severest frosts for twelve days. We had nothing
        to eat, just the thirty dekas of bread that we took along. We drove through
        Czechoslovakia, Austria. And in Austria there is a famous lager, Mauthausen.
        We stood there a whole day. They did not want to receive us. It was filled
        up. We drove back from [through?] Austria, back to Czechoslovakia. And on
        the road fifty per cent of the people died, frozen from the cold, of hunger,
        and of thirst. When someone died — it was very crowed — he was simply taken
        and thrown down the hills and valleys, wherever the place of his death happened
        to be, and covered with snow. And many people ‘don’t even know’ where their
        bones have come to be [affective distortion of linguistic structure]. En route
        back from Czechia many Czechs were tossing out bread, and many Czechs suffered
        from the Germans, because they had tossed out bread [to us]. But we arrived
        in Flossenburg. Entering Flossenburg, sixty percent of us was missing. The
        forty per cent arrived more dead than alive. We, the young ones, were taken
        into a special block for you-...youth, into Block 19. And we were immediately
        taken to the bath, washed up, and chased into the block. Inside the block
        the names of the Jews were immediately called out, and we were put to the
        side. We were given special rows of beds, and wired up with wire so that we
        should not be able to talk to the other boys. We, as Jews, were all wired
        up. In Flossenburg there were very hard moments to live through. There were
        many days in which we received twenty dekas of moldy bread and a little water
        — this was the soup, made out of water and leaves, nothing else. But we succeeded
        in living through the time. In a short time we were again taken from Buna.
        But they had no more places to take us to. They thought that they will get
        rid of us in...in Dachau. In Dachau there awaited us already a place where
        we could be exterminated. But they did not succeed in taking us as far as
        that. We...we dragged along for two weeks. During the night we walked, and
        during the day we lay in the woods. Four, five days...

      u: They had occupied...the Russians, Americans, and the English had occupied.
        So they kept us in the woods. There were no more lagers for us. While in the
        woods, we lay [there] for five days during which it rained continuously. It
        rained for five days, and we received...received no food, nothing. We ate
        the dried out [bitter?] berries, if we happened to sit close to them. But
        in case we wanted to go near [them], to go and look for the dried out [bitter?]
        berries, one was shot. One was not permitted. Fifty boys sat together, separated
        into groups, parties [?] of fifty. And around every group of fifty there stood
        twenty SS men with dogs. And to move two meters away from the group was punishable
        by death. After three days they brought a few liters of water, called out
        everybody’s name, and measured out a spoonful of water. And this was the food
        supply...the food...the food supply [Verpflegung], as it is called in German,
        for three days. And for the other two days we lay in the rain. At night, when
        one side, when I got up I could not feel the side I lay on, if it is alive
        or...or dead. I could have been beaten or pricked. I could feel absolutely
        nothing.

        who had...whom we had met on the road. And they had also gone through the
        same hardships. And we walked on. We walked again at night, and again we lay
        in the woods during the day. But this could not go on for long, because many
        people fell. Fell. Simply fell. And every meter there were corpses lying on
        both sides [of the road]. When one did not have the strength to go on, he
        would sit down. And a minute later he was lying already dead. To get us to
        Dachau...they could not bring [us there], because the communications were
        disrupted. To ride in RR-cars — the American and Russian airplanes shot up
        the RR-cars and locomotives the...the train, and we could not travel any farther.
        And they could not bring us to that certain place where they wanted to exterminate
        us. But they took each group, took them into a forest and surrounded [them],
        dug...ordered to dig their own ditches [mass graves], and bury themselves.
        But we, before...before that...before that...our group simply by accident
        had before that gone to a small town where we received three potatoes each,
        half boiled. And we were supposed to go to the place where we were going to
        be shot, but the road...we got lost on the road and walked in a different
        direction. And by this miracle we remained alive. And the others, six thousand
        who had left the lag-...six thousand Jews who had left the lager, were shot,
        and no trace [of them] has remained. Our group, the fifty people who kept
        together, who took the wrong road, succeeded in remaining alive. When the...when
        the Americans were already very close, the Germans were chasing us faster
        and faster. But we did not want to walk. There was an air-raid alarm, and
        they ran into the forest. Then I and another three comrades from my town ran
        to the other side of the forest and hid ourselves. The German looked for us
        and could not find us. After having been in the forest two, three hours, we
        saw a village burning, and nearby there stands a tank with the lettering ‘U.S.A.’
        We knew that U.S,A. stands for American. We also saw the star. But we did
        not believe that we would live to see the happy moment of liberation. Walking
        out a little farther, we see oncoming tanks, Americans. The first thing when
        we went over to the tank, there was a man with gun in hand. And he asked us
        who we are. He saw at once that we are...

  commentary:
    text: "<p>Kalman Eisenberg experienced most of the Holocaust years in his hometown
      of Starachowice, an industrial center about ninety miles south of Warsaw. There
      the Jews were placed in an open ghetto between February 1941 and October 1942.
      Then those not needed for work were sent away, to Treblinka as it turned out,
      and the remaining 5,000 were pushed into barracks adjacent to the prewar ammunition
      factories, now renamed the Hermann Goring Works, to serve the needs of the German
      military.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old Eisenberg was one of the “lucky” ones, the
      only remaining member of his family not sent away with the others. He says little
      about what it was like in the Starachowice camp, but he has fairly vivid recollections
      of the prisoner revolt that occurred as the Germans prepared to liquidate the
      camp and move their slaves westward in July 1944. Fearful that they were about
      to be killed, the prisoners set fires and rushed the fences, only to be recaptured
      or shot down by the hundreds by the Ukrainian guards. Not one is known to have
      escaped and lived to tell about it. Kalman survived to be evacuated to Auschwitz-Birkenau
      with the others, and from there to Germany where he was liberated by the Americans
      somewhere in Bavaria.</p>"

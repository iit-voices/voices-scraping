        upon verbal reports without notes or memoranda. Eh...he is rather reluctant
        to do it, but he was convinced, by Dr. Reich and myself, at least to try.
        He said that is the first time in his life. Well, we don’t think that his
        life, in spite of all his experiences, precludes to do anything for the first
        time."

      end: '00:04:41.721'
      u: In the middle of the night the Polish troops began to retreat from the front.
        A lot of troops marched so that we couldn’t remain in the city. We knew the
        Germans were approaching. The supervisor who took care of the children went
        outside. He went over to a Polish soldier. He wanted to know how to get to
        Lodz. It was a terribly dark night.

      end: '00:05:57.028'
      u: The boys divided into two groups. The older ones said we should go to Lodz;
        the younger ones said we should return to Kalisz. It was decided to go to
        Lodz, because...because we knew if we return to Kalisz we will fall into the
        Germans hands. We arrived in Lodz at daybreak. At daybreak, on the Alexander
        street, we met a group of Christians and Jews who lived on the outskirts of
        the city. We were sat down near a church. When we were asked where we are
        coming from and we said from Kalisz, nobody wanted to believe us. We ate a
        piece of bread, and we started to inquire how to get to the Jewish Council.
        The Jewish Council was very far from Alexander street. It was on Pomorska
        19. We arrived on Pomorska street. We went near the Council. There stood a
        guard. We were not let in. ‘Where do you come from?’ ‘From Kalisz.’

      start: '00:06:01.134'
      end: '00:06:01.871'
      u: Yes.
    - who: Israel Unikowski
      start: '00:06:01.871'
      end: '00:07:27.605'
      u: We weren’t let in. It was said that the whole Council had run away. Jews
        passed by. They began to ask, ‘Where are you from? Who are you?’ And when
        we told them, we were told that opposite Pormorska 19 there is also an orphanage
        that belonged to the [Jewish] community, and since nobody was there now, and
        if we want, we can go in there. Needless to say we were tired from the journey
        and we went in there. But we couldn’t stay like this without food so we/decided...we
        chose a delagation of two older boys. I was among the two, and we were supposed
        to go the Council to find out what will be. We came up to the Council with
        great difficulty. They let us enter. We were met...we were received by an
        old man completely gray. We go over to him. We showed him a paper that we
        are from there and there, that we are from Kalisz. We showed him a paper that
        we ask that the community of Lodz should take care of us [?]. The old man,
        who was the [one] later known as President Rumkowski, stopped us, read the
        petition, and answered us, ‘Dear children, I have nothing to help you.’ He
        took us through all the rooms. The bureaus [desks] were overturned, a disorder.
        And he gave us back the paper, ‘With me you can’t remain. You will die from
        hunger.’ We left the paper in his hand, and we went down. Downstairs...

      end: '00:07:30.956'

        in the Ghetto of Lodz in this way. [Pause] The worst thing in the Ghetto was
        the state of distress. We began to receive very little food. A ration, an
        allotment for fourteen days consisted in the Ghetto of the following: Three
        deka of turnips, forty deka of flour, and ten deka of oatflakes, and forty-five

        well. Because in the beginning—this was already afterwards—in the beginning
        it was much worse. In the beginning a committee was organized in every house
        [apartment house]. The committee received the allotment for the entire house,
        and they distributed it to all the people. This was very bad. They stole.
        But Rumkowski remedied this. It may be considered in favor of Rumkowski that
        he didn’t permit theft. What does it mean, he didn’t permit theft? Enough
        was stolen because whoever had a hand and a leg stole. But at least the ration
        that was allotted to every person, this at least everbody received. It was
        organized in this way. There was a warehouse. There in this warehouse the
        allotment of food was received. For example, the street [section] from Podrzeizna
        to Polska was assigned to the twentieth district-warehouse. There were in
        the Ghetto forty-three district-warehouses arranged according to streets.
        And everybody had a card, a card for bread, a card for vegetables, a card
        for nutrients//meat?/, and so forth. Today, for instance, comes out bread
        for such and such card numbers. One went to the warehouse, the card was clipped,

        This is what the Ghetto receives. The Germans have to eat too! Nobody could
        do this but the children and the old people from the Ghetto of Lodz [the deported
        ones.]. And thus we deceived ourselves with foolish ‘songs’ and made believe

        when the Viennese entered the Ghetto. They came in from [conditions of] utter
        abundance. There were among them Jews who even had served in the German army.
        When we asked them why they were sent to the Ghetto they said that the Germans
        want to protect them from the bombs, because where they are [from], there
        are severe bombings and here there are no bombings. You know the German Jews!
        In such a way people were deceived. In short, a field was alloted to them
        in God’s acre. Thousands and thousands of them died. Because we, the Polish
        Jews, became adapted to it little by little...It became worse by degrees.
        And they who entered Gehenna directly from affluence were strewn over the
        field...

        And one time we heard that they are going away. And they were all, like one,
        gassed and burned. The lager became free for [occupancy by] the Jews of the
        Ghetto of Lodz.

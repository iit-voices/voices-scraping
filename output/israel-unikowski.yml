        street, we met a group of Christians and Jews who lived on the outskirts of
        the city. We were sat down near a church. When we were asked where we are
        coming from and we said from Kalisz, nobody wanted to believe us. We ate a
        piece of bread, and we started to inquire how to get to the Jewish Council.
        The Jewish Council was very far from Alexander street. It was on Pomorska
        19. We arrived on Pomorska street. We went near the Council. There stood a
        guard. We were not let in. ‘Where do you come from?’ ‘From Kalisz.’

        And they who entered Gehenna directly from affluence were strewn over the
        field...

      u: Hans Bubov and another German arrived. They began to go out [around]...to
        go out [around] on the square. He began to look [us] over. He passed through,
        one, two, three. He came over to a small boy of ten years. ‘Oh, you little
        one. Do you know what is about to happen to you? You are all going to be shot.’
        The boy didn’t answer him anything. He marched through, two, three. He went
        over to the woman-fuerer of the orphanages, an ex-mistress of Rumkowski.

        not remain with a brother, or an acquaintance with an acquaintance. We were
        taken into a barrack, told to undress the way the mother had born us, and

  commentary:
    text: "<p>The events narrated in this interview offer a glimpse of life in the
      large urban ghettos of Poland. Had Israel Unikowsky been a bit younger, he probably
      would not have survived. His initiative and native intelligence helped, but
      without the ability to work in ghetto and camp his chances were slim. He was
      just eleven when the Germans overran his hometown of Kalisz in western Poland.
      His mother had died when he was three, and his father had abandoned him and
      an older brother four years later. Raised in a religious orphanage for Jewish
      boys aged five to thirteen, the two brothers and thirty other orphans fled from
      the Germans toward what they hoped would be the comparative safety of the nearest
      big Polish city, Łódź. They made it shortly after the Germans took Łódź on September
      8, 1939, and threw themselves on the mercy of the local Jewish community. Unikowsky
      would manage to stay there until the end of the ghetto almost five years later.</p><p>The
      morally ambiguous figure of ghetto leader Chaim Rumkowski presents itself almost
      at the beginning of Israel Unikowsky’s tale. Rumkowski, who headed the Łódź
      Jewish orphanages at the time of Poland’s downfall, at first seemed to despair
      of aiding his additional charges but later saw to their needs. One can hardly
      blame Unikowsky for hating the man who later tried to deport him and the rest
      of the ghetto children to death camps, but even Unikowsky acknowledges Rumkowski’s
      goal of saving at least some of the Jews through work and supplying them with
      rations that were fairly and efficiently distributed. This interview also introduces
      us to the far more shadowy figure of David Gertler, head of the ghetto police
      and second most powerful Jewish administrator in Łódź.</p><p>Unikowsky clearly
      shared the opinion of many ghetto inhabitants that Gertler was a more attractive
      figure than Rumkowski for his smuggling of food into and people out of the ghetto.
      Unikowsky does not mention that none of this could have been done without the
      connivance of corrupt German officials and that it led to Gertler’s arrest and
      deportation in July 1943. Evidently Gertler survived the war. The precise nature
      of his role in Łódź and his subsequent fate have never been fully clarified.
      </p><p>Unikowsky’s narrow escape from the massive deportations from Łódź in
      September 1942 is one of the more remarkable episodes in this collection. However,
      he could not evade being rounded up during the liquidation of the ghetto in
      1944. He was sent to Auschwitz where he was healthy enough and lucky enough
      to be selected for work on a nearby farm that produced food for the camp. His
      luck held at Buchenwald, too. Sent there in January 1945, he was among those
      assigned to the youth block, most of whom survived. His account shows that at
      least some liberated concentration camp inmates subjected German civilians to
      revenge attacks before leaving the country. Unikowsky moved to France where
      he was studying dental technology at the time of his interview at the ORT home
      at Chateau de Boucicaut. He expressed no particular plans for the future, however.
      For him the lesson of the Holocaust was that “thinking about tomorrow won’t
      do.”</p>\n"

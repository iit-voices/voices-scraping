** Need to watch out for this rogue character encoding: &#195;

It's used all over the place, and never for the actual character intended. Probably should have some
way of flagging files that contain that character, possibly right in the YAML.

I ran the command

  $ cat * | grep '195.*[^;]$'

to find all the instances of the problem character in lines by themselves (others were in JavaScript
portions of the document).

These are all the problems in the interviewee directory, which I've sorted alphabetically and
removed duplicate records from in Ruby (see `problem-cities.rb`):

Andrych&#195;w, Poland
Ath&#195;nai, Greece
August&#195;w, Poland
B&#195;rgermoor, Germany
Castell&#195; d Emp&#195;ries, Spain
Chorz&#195;w, Poland
Dąbrowa G&#195;rnicza, Poland
G&#195;rlitz, Germany
Jan&#195;w Lubelski, Poland
Kisv&#195;rda, Hungary
Krak&#195;w, Poland
L&#195;dź, Poland
M&#195;hldorf am Inn, Germany
M&#195;nchen, Germany
N&#195;rnberg, Germany
P&#195;rigueux, France
Ravensbr&#195;ck, Germany
Saint-&#195;tienne, France
Stasz&#195;w, Poland
Sz&#195;kesfeh&#195;rv&#195;r, Hungary
Terez&#195;n, Czechoslovakia
Thessalon&#195;ki, Greece
Tomasz&#195;w Mazowiecki, Poland
Was&#195;w, Poland

Those could be keyed in a hash to their unicode-corrected counterparts

Taking seconds and converting them to HH:MM:SS.DDD

t = "104.332"
t.split('.')
t_str = "#{Time.at(t[0].to_i).utc.strftime("%H:%M:%S")}.#{t[1]}"
# outputs "00:01:44.332"

Taking MM:SS.DDD and converting to seconds

t = "00:01:44.332"

## Transcripts and Translations

audio.php?doc=sochamiH -> unstructured HTML (no metadata), broken characters
audio?doc=sochamiH -> same as the audio.php file
interview?doc=sochamiH&display=sochamiH_en -> English, with metadata (end marks are 'x' though)
interview?doc=sochamiH&display=sochamiH_es -> Spanish, in this case, also metadata/missing end marks
interviewee?doc=sochamiH



interview\?doc=kharchenkoI\&display=kharchenkoI_ru
interview\?doc=kharchenkoI\&display=kharchenkoI_ru


## Scraping Spot-checking
* It's worth thinking about whether to preserve the complete legacy MP3 file names, or to update
  them somehow. It's probably worth preserving in the name the spool information, at any rate.

* Roma Tcharnabroda has two audio files; I've set the hash to comma-separate them, but the two
  MP3 files should probably be joined into one. There's also something funky happening around line
  420 of her .yml file with start: and end: markers.
